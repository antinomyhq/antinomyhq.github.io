With the recent release of Kimi K2 from Moonshot AI<sup><a id="ref-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, which is an open-source model that many consider to be a viable alternative to Claude Sonnet 4.

I couldn't stop myself from conducting real-world coding tests between Kimi K2 and the recently released Grok 4 model. Both of these models are considered top models for coding, but the result is quite shocking. One of the models completely outperformed the other, as it's said the main test comes from using and testing in a real-world scenario rather than blindly following the synthetic metrics shared about the models.

---

## Testing Methodology and Setup

To keep things real, I've tested both models on an actual, fairly complex Next.js application where I introduced some bugs and asked both of them to fix them, implement a few new features, and see how well they can handle tool calls.

I've used the same prompts for both of these models to keep things fair and consistent.

### Testing Categories

1. **Find and fix bugs (5 tasks):** Identify bugs with reproducible steps and test coverage

2. **Implement new features (4 tasks):** Add new functionality, including a chat agent with tool-calling capabilities using Composio MCP

3. **Code refactor:** Improve code structure and readability without breaking any functionality

### Evaluation Criteria

- First and foremost, the code must be correct with no logic errors.
- How well the model follows the prompt and stays on task.
- The overall code quality and structure.
- The time taken to complete the given task.
- Finally, one of the most important factors I'll consider is the overall token efficiency.

## Performance Analysis

:::note
The entire test is conducted using our Forge CLI.

Here's the performance comparison between Kimi K2 and Grok 4 across 9 tasks:

### Execution Metrics

| Metric                | Kimi K2          | Grok 4       | Notes                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Avg Response Time     | ~11.7-22s        | ~10.3-16s    | K2 had a faster first token, but Grok finished quicker.                                             |
| Single-Prompt Success | 6/9              | 7/9          | K2 was close, but Grok 4 usually got it right on the first try.                                     |
| Tool Call Accuracy    | 76.5% (AceBench) | ~99%         | K2 did well in agentic workflows, but Grok nailed structured tool calls.                            |
| Bug Detection         | 4/5 (80%)        | 5/5 (100%)   | K2 found edge cases well, but Grok handled code changes much better.                                |
| Code Quality          | Decent           | Professional | K2 was a bit more verbose, but Grok was more focused on code quality.                               |
| Prompt Adherence      | 7/9              | 8/9          | K2 and Grok were both excellent, but Grok felt more on track, while K2 occasionally went off track. |

**Test Sample:** 9 tasks, repeated 3 times for consistency
**Confidence Level:** High, based on manual verification

Overall, both models felt solid in my test, but Grok 4 has a slight edge, as you can see above. It was more accurate with tool use, caught more bugs, and fixed them all with really great code and better test cases. Kimi K2 did really well too, but at times it wrote code with many unused variables, had a slight problem with prompt following, and was a bit slower. In short, Grok 4 was a bit more polished, but we can't undermine the fact that Kimi K2 comes with this great performance at a fraction of the cost of Grok 4, so that's something to consider here.

## Speed and Overall Token Usage

When it comes to the response speed of both models, I didn't notice much difference. Both models are quite slow at generating responses. Considering an average coding prompt with about 1,000 tokens, Grok outputs around 50 tokens per second, while Kimi K2 outputs about 47 tokens per second.

:::note
Many providers, like Groq<sup><a id="ref-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, offer high output speed (tokens per second), but here we're focusing on a standard use case with a typical provider.
:::

However, if we compare the latency (TTFT - time to first token), Grok 4 has a typical latency of 11-16 seconds for heavier reasoning modes, while Kimi K2 has lower latency, just about 0.52s to receive the first token.

Kimi K2 is a non-reasoning model but uses about three times the tokens of an average non-reasoning model. Its token usage is only about 30% lower than reasoning models like Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus when running in maximum budget extended thinking mode.

Now, if we look into the overall token usage in the entire test and in general, Grok 4 consumed significantly many tokens, especially in "Think" mode. To prevent that, if you cap the `max_tokens` too low, it may stop output prematurely.

But, in addition to the slower response time, there's a catch with Grok 4 rate limits.

One thing I really hate about this model is the rate limit that's implemented on top of xAI<sup><a id="ref-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>. Almost every 2-3 requests, you get rate-limited for a few minutes straight. That could be something that throws you off. I didn't notice any rate limits with Kimi K2.

## Pricing Breakdown

On average, each task cost me about $5.80 with Grok 4, using approximately 200k output tokens, while with Kimi K2, it cost around $0.40 using about 160k output tokens, which is about one-fourteenth the price of Grok 4.

Grok 4 costs $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.

But, isn't the Grok 4 pricing of $5.80 more than what it should be for 200k tokens? Yes, you're right, ideally it shouldn't be $5.80 for 200k tokens, but Grok 4 pricing doubles after 128k tokens.

Kimi K2 comes with $0.15 per million input tokens and $2.50 per million output tokens, and it stays flat no matter the token usage.

The best part is that you can access the free tier of Kimi K2 on OpenRouter<sup><a id="ref-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>. This is perfect for testing with smaller projects, allowing you to experiment before fully committing to the model.

## Overall Impressions of Each Model

Now, let's look into the overall impression of these models in our entire test and in general, along with the good and bad sides and when you'd want to use each model.

### Kimi K2

- **Ultra cost-efficient**: At just $2.50 per million output tokens (plus $0.15 per million input tokens), typical tasks (~160K tokens) ran around $0.40 which is ideal for heavy workflows on a budget.
- **Super fast startup**: Time to first token is only ~0.5s, which makes interactions and tool-based workflows feel snappy.
- **Built for agentic coding**: Great at handling multi-step tasks, API calls, and integrations without complex setup.
- **Supports long context**: With about 128K token window, it can take on whole codebases or documentation in one pass.
- **Developer-friendly openness**: The model is open-source with a permissive license mean you can fine-tune, or self-host as needed.
- **Mild downside**: Slower token throughput (~45 tokens/sec) means long responses take longer and it sometimes over-explains or hallucinates details.

### Grok 4

- **Reasoning and coding elite**: Top-tier scores on tough benchmarks like SWE‑bench, ARC‑AGI, and Humanity’s Last Exam, much better in coding and reasoning compared to Kimi K2.
- **Larger context support**: Handles up to ~256K tokens (although cost doubles past 128K), better than most models available right now.
- **Subtle drawbacks**: High output token cost ($15/M, doubling beyond 128K), latency to first token ~11–13s in heavy reasoning modes, and actual runtime speed (~47–75 tokens/sec) can be noticeably slow in long coding sessions.

### Quick Stats Comparison

| Metric                   | Kimi K2                             | Grok 4                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Typical cost/task**    | ~$0.40 (160K tokens)                | ~$5–6 (200K tokens, cost doubles past 128K)    |
| **Latency (TTFT)**       | ~0.5s                               | ~11–16s in reasoning-heavy workflows           |
| **Output speed**         | ~45 tokens/sec                      | ~47–75 tokens/sec (varies by mode)             |
| **Accuracy & reasoning** | Strong for agentic coding workflows | Top-tier in math, logic, and coding benchmarks |
| **Tool integration**     | Smooth API/tool orchestration       | Integrated real-time search & execution        |
| **Context window**       | ~128K tokens                        | Up to ~256K tokens                             |
| **Open model**           | Yes                                 | No                                             |

### When to Choose Which

- **Choose Kimi K2** if you want low cost per task, need fast response start times, and happy with a decent code generation ability.
- **Choose Grok 4** for tasks that demand maximum reasoning accuracy, detailed coding, and a model that supports long context windows.

## Conclusion

After looking at these two models and their performance, I'm definitely going with Grok 4, but Kimi K2 is a great option if you're looking for a more cost-efficient model for daily workflows. Grok 4 is much better with the code and got the most work done in the first try, though costlier compared to Kimi K2 and the rate limit can be really frustrating at times, but it felt much reliable with the implementation, bug fixes and tool calls.

Even though, Grok 4 won me here, but both have their own strengths and weaknesses, so I'm sure you'll find the model that best fits your workflow and budget.
