CLI coding agents have been getting more popular mainly for how well they build context across multiple projects and run parallel tasks straight from the terminal. IDE agents, on the other hand offer code help right inside editors, providing real-time suggestions and integrations that can improve your coding in a visual workspace.

I have been spending time with both types of agents, so here’s a real-world breakdown of how they work (along with DX), what makes each one strong and when you might want to use one over the other.

This post also covers hidden benefits of CLI Agents like spawning parallel subagents along with the challenges they bring and how we can work around them.

---

## TL;DR

- CLI agents run in your terminal, leveraging full project context across multiple repos and can execute complex, multi-file tasks with powerful automation and scripting capabilities.  

- IDE agents live inside your code editor, offering real-time inline suggestions and code completions, best for quick edits and context-limited assistance.  

- CLI agents are async, IDE-agnostic and operate on entire repos with file diffs. IDE agents are interactive, cloud-bound and focus on indexed files with instant pop-up feedback.

- Use IDE agents for fast boilerplate generation and single-file tasks. CLI agents excel at large-scale refactors, codebase audits, multi-step scripting and automation.  

- CLI agents like Claude Code can spawn subagents that each handle narrow tasks in parallel. This improves speed, reduces token waste, and avoids bloated prompts. CLI agents work inside isolated git environments (like worktrees), staging changes separately. This allows test-gated commits, safe rollbacks and granular diffs.

- CLI agents face issues like large diffs, high token use, memory limits and repeat edits. Practical fixes include scoping tasks, planning prompts, compacting context and diff-based checkpoints to avoid redundant changes.

## What are CLI Coding Agents?

CLI coding agents are AI tools that live directly in your terminal, that can understand your natural language commands and execute complex coding tasks without ever leaving the command line. Instead of a graphical interface, you invoke them via shell commands at your project root.

What makes CLI agents unique is their **ability to build context from multiple projects**. These agents have direct access to your full project environment (file system, environment variables, installed tools, etc). 

So when you instruct the agent to `update the authentication system`, it’s not just scanning a single file. It understands how auth flows through your routes, middleware, database models, and even frontend components.

For example, a simple `codex explain the architecture of this project` can trigger the agent to read through your codebase and return a high-level overview.

**Popular CLI Agents:**

1) `Claude Code CLI` :  lets you manage multiple projects and automate workflows directly from your terminal. It's Docker-based, so each request is sandboxed<sup><a id="ref-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.

You can install it with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.

2) `ForgeCode` : terminal-based coding agent that works with leading AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc). It nails the “zero config” promise<sup><a id="ref-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>.

 You can launch it quickly with `npx forgecode@latest`.

3) `OpenAI Codex CLI` : brings the power of OpenAI's latest models (such as o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1) directly to your terminal. Your code stays private and supports multimodal input<sup><a id="ref-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>.

You can install it using `npm install -g @openai/codex`.

4) `Aider` : it supports many LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek, OpenAI), auto-commits code changes, supports multi-file, multi-language projects and can even take voice instructions. Ideal for AI pair programming<sup><a id="ref-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>.

You can install it using `python -m pip install aider-install`.

5) `Google Gemini CLI` : brings Google’s Gemini models to your terminal. It supports chaining actions and even running background tasks, which can be great for orchestrating multi-step fixes<sup><a id="ref-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>.

You can install it using `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`.

6) `OpenCode` : flexible, scriptable CLI app that connects to dozens of AI models including local ones. It also lets you share sessions<sup><a id="ref-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>.

You can install it using `npm i -g opencode-ai@latest`.

7) `Plandex` : can index and reason over very large codebases (millions of tokens). It generates a project map using Tree-sitter and can handle multi-file workflows with context-caching across models. It also auto-debug commands<sup><a id="ref-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup>.

You can install it using `curl -sL https://plandex.ai/install.sh | bash`.

Some CLI agents like Aider can auto-commit changes with sensible messages and even run tests or linters after edits, making it an extension for your normal workflow.

## What are IDE Agents?

**IDE coding agents** are AI assistants embedded directly into your code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.). The most famous example is GitHub Copilot, which pops up inline code completions and suggestions as you type.

Other examples include AWS CodeWhisperer (part of Amazon Q Dev), Codeium (Windsurf), Tabnine, Cursor's Agent Mode and open source editors like Continue.dev.

They typically have broad language and library knowledge built in and they work with the editor’s existing features (linting, version control).

They excel in inline assistance such as analyzing the code you are currently writing and suggesting the next few lines based on your patterns (and context).

But Modern IDE agents have now evolved beyond simple autocomplete. GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode can now work autonomously on assigned GitHub issues, creating pull requests with complete implementations<sup><a id="ref-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>. `Cursor's Composer` can modify multiple files simultaneously while maintaining the visual context of your editor.

## Developer Experience: How They Work

At the end of the day, Developer Experience (DX) matters a lot. Here's a brief comparison:

**CLI agents:**

- These are IDE-agnostic as they can run in any editor.
- Flexible about which AI models you can use (including local models).
- There’s no pop-up window, changes appear as file diffs or commits.
- Operate with deep repo context, see the whole project, not just what’s visible in the editor.
- Runs locally (or on-prem) which keeps your code on your machine. Each action is transparent (you see the commands in your shell history or Git logs).

They can leverage any command-line tool or script, meaning you can use `grep`, `sed` or build custom scripts. You can have it run tests and linters automatically.

You execute an agent-specific command and the agent interacts via plain-text prompts and diffs. Proposes a plan and asks for confirmation before making changes. For example:

```shell
$ codex "Add user authentication to my Express app"
I'll help you add authentication. Here's my plan:
   1. Install passport and express-session
   2. Create auth middleware
   3. Add login/logout routes
   4. Update the user model with password hashing
   5. Protect existing routes

Proceed? (y/n)
```

The workflow is **asynchronous** and **batch-oriented**.

**IDE agents:**

- Tied to the ecosystem (like VSCode extensions can run in similar IDEs).
- Usually tied to one vendor’s cloud model (Copilot uses OpenAI, CodeWhisperer uses AWS/Anthropic) so you have less choice.
- There’s a pop-up window showing the changes, including file diffs.
- Operate on the current file or project context loaded in the editor.
- Commonly use cloud services, meaning your code snippets are sent to external servers.

They rely on the editor’s extension points: they work well with built-in IDE features, but can’t natively run something like `docker build` unless the plugin supports it.

The workflow is **synchronously** and **interactively**.

## When Does Each Shine (Ground Reality)

Both agents can improve productivity but CLI agents tend to win out in real-world workflows. Here’s where each one really proves its value:

**Quick Editing & Autocomplete**

For day-to-day coding (writing a new function, filling in boilerplate, little one-off tasks), IDE agents are perfect. I was reading about the impact of GitHub Copilot and as per sources, developers noticed 55% faster task completion<sup><a id="ref-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>.

**Complex Refactors & Multi-File Tasks**

CLI agents excel at these big tasks. If you need to migrate code across a repo, refactor a whole module or apply a bulk edit, you just need to run one command (such as `codex refactor oldName newName`) and the agent can touch many files, run tests and do all the changes in one go.

**Code Review & Analysis**

When you need to understand or audit a codebase, CLI agents have the advantage of full context. They “see” your entire directory structure and environment.

IDE agents only “see” what’s open or indexed. They miss the broader context unless you do a lot of manual loading.

**Automation & Scripting**

CLI agents integrate naturally into scripts and CI pipelines. For example, you could automate releases, generate Docker configurations, backups or documentation updates with CLI prompts. IDE agents are mostly for interactive use and don’t fit into non-interactive scripts.

In general, you should use an IDE agent for “in the zone” coding and switch to the terminal/CLI agent for complex, multi-step chores.

## Hidden Benefits of CLI Agents

CLI agents come with a bunch of underrated benefits like parallel subagents, sandboxed shells, git-level isolation, test-gated commits and auditability that IDE agents typically can’t match (or fake at best).

So let's understand how some of these work and why they matter.

### Parallel Subagents

Some CLI agents like Claude Code stand out for their ability to dispatch parallel subagents<sup><a id="ref-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>. Each subagent gets a minimal, focused prompt with only the info it needs so it uses fewer tokens, avoids unrelated context and finishes faster.

By narrowing each agent’s prompt scope and file set, the model wastes fewer cycles on irrelevant code paths or history. That leads to more stable, precise output per task.

As a subagent only attends to narrow tokens related to the task, it has less noise from unrelated tokens. Like if you use Gemini 2.5 Pro, when the context window is more than 200k, it is much dumber.

This leads to massive gains in speed and quality. Since subagents run in parallel, you are not waiting on one step to finish before the next begins. The total completion time stays closer to the **longest subtask** instead of the **sum**. 

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t58caqn1tssjy40u3jln.png" alt="subagents in claude code" width="100%" />

Claude Code extensively uses subagents to explore, search the codebase and it's much better than RAG-based approach (Cursor, Windsurf) or simple naive ripgrep search of Cline/RooCode/ZentaraCode.

For big codebases or multi-part refactors, this can make a big difference which something IDE agents and most other tools (like Roo Code) still lack.

Example Prompt:

```
Use the task tool to create 10 parallel tasks. This is a simulation, use the sleep command to simulate a wait, timeout value from 5 to 30 seconds.
```

The result:

```
I'll create 10 parallel tasks using the Task tool to simulate concurrent operations with sleep commands.
```

```

● All 10 parallel tasks completed successfully with simulated execution times ranging from 5 to 30 seconds.
```

### Strict atomic workflows with git-level isolation

Another CLI advantage: strict, atomic workflows that actually mirror how engineers work.

Unlike IDE agents, which typically generate one-off changes inside the editor, CLI agents often run in **isolated git environments** like `worktree` branches or temp directories. This gives them full control over context, state and version history without touching your working branch until the changes are verified.

Each subagent or task stages its own changes using **context-aware commit heuristics**, often bundled with optional CI, linters or test runners. If a test fails or a patch is invalid, you can rerun just that specific subagent without restarting the entire process. 

All changes are visible through batched tool calls (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`) and CLI agents like Claude even use internal commands (like `NB`) to keep metadata clean, parallel and fast.

This architecture means you can treat the CLI interaction like a pipeline:

- Generate a test summary (JSON)
- Trigger lint/test hooks
- Draft a PR with commit descriptions
- Apply or revert patches on failure
- Resume from partial execution

That level of granularity, audit-logging and modular rollback logic is the core principle of CLI agents. It's mostly invisible until you dig into the `.claude/` project files. And it’s what lets CLI agents behave less like chatbots and more like engineered collaborators.

## Common Challenges with CLI Agents & How to fix them

CLI Agents are not bulletproof. They come with rough edges, especially when you are pushing the limits. Here are some common issues (based mostly on Claude Code) and how to work around them:

### 1) Managing very large diffs can be overwhelming.

**The Problem:** When agents touch too many files, it becomes hard to track what’s changed.

**Fix it with:**

- Scope flags (`--dir=src/components`) to limit scope to a subdirectory.
- Ask for a summary of the diff instead of raw patches.
- Always preview with `git diff` before letting it commit.

It also helps to explicitly ask the agent for summaries or smaller steps rather than one huge output.

### 2) Token Overuse & Unexpected Costs.

**The Problem:** “I think Claude Code… uses way too many tokens. I probably burnt $100 before I realized it was stuck in a loop.” - user on r/ClaudeAI<sup><a id="ref-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>.

**Fix it with:**

- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks.
- Use planning prompts (`char SPEC → plan`) instead of one big prompt.
- Offload repetitive context (like style guides or goals) into `.CLAUDE.md` so they don’t repeat on every subagent.
- Watch token stats live using `claude --verbose` and pause when it spikes.

### 3) Context Overflow / Memory Limit Errors

**The Problem:** “The only problem is this memory limit error… I hit it fast, and that sucks.” - user describing CLI sessions<sup><a id="ref-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup>.

**Fix it with:**

- Use `/compact` or `--context-window` flags to trim history.
- Use `gptree` to generate a tree and only include the file paths that matter.
- Add checkpoints. Pause or restart the agent mid-run if it starts failing.

### 4) “Self‑Fixing” Loops or Repeat Writes

**The Problem:** Subagents can lose memory of what’s already changed and start repeating themselves.

**Fix it with:**

- Tell the agent to stop when no new edits are needed (`run once` logic).
- Use git diffs as checkpoints: if the output is empty, skip the next step.
- After each patch, run unit tests or checks, then branch off that commit for the next subagent.

It's not the same in all CLI Agents but once you know what to watch for, they become way easier to control.

---

## Bottom Line

Use the **IDE agent** when you are in heads-down coding mode and want zero-friction help. They plug into your editor and provide instant feedback. If you need auditability, privacy or bulk automation, give **CLI agents** a try. 

With features like parallel subagents, atomic Git workflows and scriptable pipelines, CLI agents provide a level of control that IDE agents often abstract away. The setup and trading some convenience could be worth the cost.
