description: "An explanation of why we've paused our early access Max plan, our commitment to fair usage, and what's next for our high-tier plans."

First, a huge thank you. When we launched our early access, we hoped a few pioneers like you would help us test our limits. You did that and more, leading to a 5x surge in signups and a 20x spike in usage.

This explosive growth is the best problem a startup can have, and it’s given us a clear signal: it’s time to build a more sustainable platform. The "unlimited" early access plan was a great experiment, but it’s not built for this scale, especially when our most active users are driving over $500/day in costs.

### The Challenge of free unlimited trials

We quickly discovered a pattern that many platforms face: a small fraction of users were responsible for a huge percentage of the resource consumption. In our case, our top 1% of users were running workloads so intensive that they were costing us over $500 per user, per day to support.

While we were blown away by what they were accomplishing, we had to face a hard reality: this wasn’t sustainable. More importantly, it wasn’t fair to the thousands of other users on the waitlist and those who were trying to get a feel for the platform. The firehose of usage from a few accounts was beginning to impact the experience for everyone.

Our goal has always been to build a tool that adds real value to your development workflow. We also believe that developers should be able to try before they buy. You need to get your hands on the product, integrate it into your process, and see the benefits for yourself. An unlimited free-for-all was paradoxically making that _harder_ for the majority of our users.

### Our Solution: A Fair Free Tier for Everyone

So, we’ve made a change. We have retired the early access Max plan and moved all users to our new **Free** tier.

This tier is designed to give every developer a clear and consistent way to test, experiment, and integrate Forge. To start, we're setting the limit at **50 requests per day**. We're sharing this number upfront because we believe in transparency. As we gather more data on usage and server load, we may adjust this limit in the future to ensure the platform remains stable and performant for everyone.

For those of you who need more power and higher limits, our **Pro plan** is available for upgrade at any time. We’ve already seen many of our active users make the jump, and we’re incredibly grateful for their support. It’s a huge vote of confidence in what we’re building.

### What’s Next? The Max Plan Returns at Launch

For everyone who has asked about a higher-tier, power-user plan - we hear you. The "Max" plan, or a version of it, is absolutely in our roadmap. We’re re-tooling it based on the data we’ve gathered, and it will be a core part of our official launch in a couple of weeks.

We're moving all our focus to make sure the official Max plan is robust, fair, and ready for our launch in a couple of weeks.

If you’ve found Forge valuable and need higher, more consistent limits, the Pro plan is your next step.

Thank you for being part of this journey. The passion and creativity from this community have been incredible. This is just one of the many lessons we’ll learn as we scale, and we’re committed to being transparent about it every step of the way.
