# Forge Documentation Getting Started Section Improvement

## Objective
Transform Forge's getting started documentation from a feature-heavy technical introduction to a value-driven, hands-on onboarding experience that follows Claude Code's proven approach while highlighting Forge's unique differentiators.

## Implementation Plan

- **Feature Discovery**: Users understand Forge's unique value proposition and key differentiators
- **Progressive Learning**: Clear learning path from beginner to advanced usage
- **Support Reduction**: Decreased support requests for basic setup and usage questions
- **Engagement Metrics**: Improved time on page, reduced bounce rate, higher conversion to active usage

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Content Restructuring Disruption**
   - Risk: Existing users may be confused by navigation changes
   - Mitigation: Implement redirects, add "What's Changed" notice, maintain backward compatibility

2. **Technical Accuracy During Simplification**
   - Risk: Simplified explanations may lose important technical details
   - Mitigation: Layer information with expandable sections, link to detailed technical docs

3. **Feature Overwhelm for Beginners**
   - Risk: Forge's advanced features (agents, MCP, custom rules) may intimidate new users
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, focus on core value first, advanced features in later sections

4. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - Risk: More comprehensive documentation requires ongoing updates
   - Mitigation: Create update templates, assign ownership, implement review cycles

5. **Competitive Positioning Balance**
   - Risk: Following Claude Code too closely may diminish Forge's unique positioning
   - Mitigation: Emphasize unique differentiators while adopting proven UX patterns

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Gradual Enhancement**: Improve existing pages incrementally rather than major restructure
2. **Separate Onboarding Site**: Create dedicated onboarding flow separate from main documentation
3. **Video-First Approach**: Lead with video tutorials supplemented by written documentation
4. **Interactive Tutorial**: Build in-browser interactive tutorial before directing to installation

## Success Metrics

- Time to first successful command execution: Target <5 minutes
- Documentation completion rate: Target >80% for getting started section
- User satisfaction scores: Target >4.5/5 for onboarding experience
- Support ticket reduction: Target 30% decrease in basic setup questions
- Feature adoption: Target 50% of new users try advanced features within first week
