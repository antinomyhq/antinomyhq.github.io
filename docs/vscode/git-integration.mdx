# Stop Writing Commit Messages

Writing good commit messages is important. Writing them manually for every change is tedious. Let Forge analyze your changes and generate meaningful commit messages instantly.

## What This Does

The VS Code extension integrates directly with Git to provide:

- **AI Commit Messages**: Generate commit messages based on your staged changes
- **Smart Commit**: Commit with Forge attribution visible on GitHub
- **One-Click Workflow**: Generate and commit without leaving VS Code

## Generate Commit Message

Click the Forge icon in the Source Control panel to generate a commit message from your staged changes.

### How It Works

1. **Stage your changes** in the Source Control panel
2. **Click the Forge icon** (or use Command Palette: "Generate Commit Message with Forge")
3. **Forge analyzes the diff** and generates a descriptive commit message
4. **Message appears in the input box**: Edit if needed, then commit

The generated message follows conventional commit style and describes what changed and why.

### Example

**Your changes:**
```diff
+ function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
+   const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
+   return emailRegex.test(email);
+ }
```

**Generated message:**
```
feat(validation): add email validation function

Add validateEmail utility function with regex-based email format checking.
Returns boolean indicating whether the provided email string is valid.
```

### Stop Generation

If generation is taking too long or you want to cancel:

- Click the **Stop** button that replaces the Forge icon during generation
- Or use Command Palette: "Stop Generating Commit Message"

## Automatic Forge Attribution

When the Forge extension is installed, **every commit you make automatically includes Forge attribution**. There's nothing extra you need to do.

### How It Works

Whenever a commit happens in your workspace whether from VS Code's Source Control panel, the terminal, or any other Git client the extension:

1. Detects the commit event
2. Automatically amends it with Forge as the committer
3. Shows a brief status bar message with the Forge icon

Your commits will have:

- **Author**: You (your normal Git identity)
- **Committer**: ForgeCode (`ForgeCode <noreply@forgecode.dev>`)

This shows up on GitHub and other Git platforms, making it clear when AI assisted with the code.

### Alternative: Command Palette

You can also commit directly using the Command Palette:

1. Stage your changes
2. Write your commit message in the input box
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
4. Select: **"Commit (Forge Attribution)"**

This does the same thing as the automatic method but bypasses VS Code's default commit flow.

### Why Attribution Matters

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Shows which commits had AI assistance |
| **Team Visibility** | Teammates can see Forge contributions in git log |
| **GitHub Integration** | Attribution visible on commit history pages |
| **Audit Trail** | Track AI-assisted changes over time |

## Configuration

### `forge.commitMessage.maxDiffSize`

Maximum size of the git diff sent to Forge for commit message generation.

- **Type**: Number (bytes)
- **Default**: `10000` (10 KB)
- **Minimum**: `10000`

**Why this exists:** Large diffs can overwhelm the AI and slow down generation. The setting limits how much diff context is sent.

**When to increase:**
- If you frequently have large commits and messages seem incomplete
- For monorepo or multi-file refactoring commits

```json
{
  "forge.commitMessage.maxDiffSize": 20000
}
```

## Requirements

### Forge CLI Version

Commit message generation requires **Forge CLI v1.5.0 or higher**.

If you have an older version, the extension will prompt you to update:

```bash
npm install -g forgecode@latest
```

### Git Repository

These features only work in folders that are Git repositories. The extension checks for:

- Valid Git repository (`.git` folder exists)
- Staged changes (for commit message generation)
- Git extension enabled in VS Code

## Troubleshooting

### "No Git Repository Found"

Make sure you've opened a folder that contains a `.git` directory. The Source Control panel should show your repository.

### "No Changes to Commit"

Stage some changes first:
1. Go to Source Control panel (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)
2. Click the `+` icon next to changed files to stage them
3. Then generate the commit message

### Commit Message Is Empty or Generic

This can happen when:
- The diff is too large and gets truncated
- Changes are minimal (e.g., whitespace only)
- Try increasing `forge.commitMessage.maxDiffSize`

### "Forge Version Outdated"

Update your Forge CLI:

```bash
npm install -g forgecode@latest
```

Then try again.
