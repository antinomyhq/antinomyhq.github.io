# Skip the Copy-Paste: Reference Any Code Instantly

Tired of manually typing file paths and copying code snippets when asking Forge for help? This VS Code extension lets you reference any code with a single keystroke and start Forge sessions directly from your editor.

## What This Extension Does

**The problem:** Describing code problems is slow and unclear

- "That function around line 50 something..."
- Copy-pasting code snippets manually
- Typing out long file paths

**The solution:** Show Forge exactly what you mean

- Select any code → Press `Ctrl+U` → Get a perfect reference
- Works with single lines, code blocks, or entire files

:::info Prerequisite: Forge CLI
This extension works with [Forge CLI](/docs/installation). Install that first if you haven't already.

**What you just saw:** Select code → Press `Ctrl+U` → Reference copied and ready to use with Forge.

## Installation

### What You Need

- **VS Code**: Version 1.102.0 or higher
- **Forge CLI**: [Install](/docs/installation) it first if you haven't already

### Install the Extension

**Option 1: VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)**

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions panel
3. Search for **"Forge Code"**
4. Click **Install** on the official ForgeCode extension

**Option 2: Command Line**

```bash
code --install-extension ForgeCode.forge-vscode
```

**Test that it works:** Open any code file, select some text, press `Ctrl+U`. If a file reference gets copied to your clipboard, you're ready to go!

**Official extension:** [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ForgeCode.forge-vscode)

## Basic Usage

### The Core Workflow

1. **Select code** (or don't select anything for whole file)
2. **Press `Ctrl+U`**
3. **Paste into Forge** conversation

That's it. No typing, no manual copying.

**What gets copied:**

Format: `@[<filepath>:<line start>:<line end>]`

**How selection works:**

- **No selection**: `@[path/to/file.js]` → References entire file
- **Single line**: `@[path/to/file.js:42:42]` → References line 42 only
- **Multiple lines**: `@[path/to/file.js:15:28]` → References lines 15-28

### Power Move: Multi-File References

Here's the real power move. You can reference multiple files in a single Forge prompt by copying and pasting references one at a time:

**Example:**

```
> Compare these approaches @[src/utils/oldMethod.js:15:45] @[src/utils/newMethod.js:20:50]
> Review this component and its styles @[components/Button.tsx] @[styles/button.css:12:34]
```

Now Forge can see exactly what code you're talking about, with full context and precise line numbers. No more "that function around line 50 something" conversations.

**Alternative ways to copy:**

- **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Copy File Reference"
- **Right-click Menu**: Select code → right-click → "Forge Code" → "Copy File Reference"

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The extension provides multiple shortcuts for copying file references:

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+U` | Copy File Reference | Uses your default format setting |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Copy Absolute Path | Always copies with absolute path |
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Copy Relative Path | Always copies with relative path |

**Example outputs:**

- **Absolute**: `@[/home/user/project/src/utils/helper.ts:15:28]`
- **Relative**: `@[src/utils/helper.ts:15:28]`

Use `Ctrl+U` for everyday use (respects your settings), or the specific shortcuts when you need a particular format.

### Context Menu

Right-click in the editor or file explorer to access the **"Forge Code"** submenu:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/images/docs/context-menu.png"
    alt="Forge context menu"
    style={{borderRadius: '8px', boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)', maxWidth: '100%'}}
  />
</div>

The submenu contains:

- **Start New Forge Session**: Open Forge in a new terminal
- **Copy Absolute Path**: Copy reference with absolute path
- **Copy Relative Path**: Copy reference with relative path

### Start New Forge Session

Start a Forge terminal directly in VS Code without switching windows.

**How to use:**

- **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Start New Forge Session"
- **Right-click Menu**: Right-click in any file → "Start New Forge Session"
- **Editor Toolbar**: Click the Forge icon in the top-right of the editor

The extension will:

1. Create a new integrated terminal in VS Code
2. Navigate to your workspace directory
3. Start Forge automatically
4. Auto-paste any file reference from the current editor (if open)

## Real-World Examples

### Debugging Issues

**Scenario:** Authentication fails in production but works locally.

```
> Help me debug this auth function @[src/auth/AuthService.ts:45:67] works locally but fails in production
```

Forge sees the exact code and can suggest environment-specific issues to check.

### Code Reviews

**Scenario:** You spot a component that could be improved.

```
> Can you refactor this component to use hooks? @[components/UserProfile.tsx:12:89] Also suggest performance optimizations
```

Instead of generic advice, Forge sees your specific component and suggests targeted improvements.

### Type Mismatches

**Scenario:** API data doesn't match your TypeScript types.

```
> @[src/api/users.js:156:203] @[src/types/User.ts] have a type mismatch. API returns 'user_id' but type expects 'userId'
```

Forge compares both files simultaneously and suggests proper fixes.

### Feature Implementation

**Scenario:** Adding dark mode across multiple components.

```
> Add dark mode support to @[src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx:15:45] and update @[src/styles/theme.css:23:67]
```

Forge understands your theme system and suggests consistent changes across files.

## Configuration

The extension provides several settings to customize its behavior. Access settings via **File → Preferences → Settings → Extensions → Forge**.

### File Reference Settings

#### `forge.fileReferenceFormat`

Choose the default path format when copying file references with `Ctrl+U`.

- **Type**: String (dropdown)
- **Options**:
  - `absolute` (default): Full absolute paths
  - `relative`: Workspace-relative paths
- **Default**: `absolute`

**When to use `absolute`:** Works reliably in all scenarios including multi-root workspaces and files outside the workspace.

**When to use `relative`:** Best for sharing references with teammates or when paths are long. Paths are shorter and portable across machines.

:::tip
You can always use `Ctrl+Shift+A` (absolute) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (relative) to override this setting on-the-fly.
:::

### Terminal Settings

#### `forge.openTerminal`

Controls when the extension opens a Forge terminal.

- **Type**: String (dropdown)
- **Options**:
  - `once` (default): Open terminal once and reuse it for subsequent operations
  - `never`: Only copy file reference to clipboard, never open terminal
- **Default**: `once`

**When to use `once`:** Most users should use this. The extension intelligently manages Forge terminals, creating one when needed and reusing it for subsequent file references.

**When to use `never`:** Use this if you always work with Forge in an external terminal and only want the extension to copy file references to clipboard without any terminal interaction.

#### `forge.autoPaste`

Automatically paste file references into the Forge terminal.

- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `true`

**When to disable:** If you prefer to manually paste references, or if auto-pasting interferes with your workflow.

#### `forge.pasteDelay`

Delay in milliseconds before auto-pasting file reference into a newly created Forge terminal.

- **Type**: Number
- **Default**: `5000` (5 seconds)
- **Range**: 0-30000 milliseconds

**Why this exists:** When the extension creates a new Forge terminal, it needs time to start up before accepting input. This delay ensures the file reference is pasted after Forge is ready.

**When to adjust:**

- If file references aren't being pasted: Increase the value (try 7000-15000ms)
- If you have a fast machine and want quicker pasting: Decrease the value (try 2000-3000ms)
- Note: This only affects newly created terminals, not existing ones

### Advanced Settings

#### `forge.binPath`

Custom path to the Forge executable.

- **Type**: String
- **Default**: Empty (uses PATH)

**When to use:** If Forge is installed in a non-standard location or you want to use a specific version.

```json
{
  "forge.binPath": "/usr/local/bin/forge"
}
```

This overrides the `FORGE_BIN` environment variable.

#### `forge.notifications`

Control which notifications the extension shows.

- **Type**: Object
- **Default**: All enabled

```json
{
  "forge.notifications": {
    "info": true,
    "warning": true,
    "error": true
  }
}
```

**When to adjust:** Disable `info` notifications if you find them too frequent. Keep `error` enabled to catch important issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

**Quick fixes to try:**

1. Verify Forge CLI is installed. Run `forge --version` in terminal
2. Check your VS Code version (Help > About). Need 1.102.0+
3. Verify the extension is enabled in Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
4. Restart VS Code completely

### Keyboard Shortcut Not Working

**`Ctrl+U` does nothing:**

This usually means another extension grabbed that shortcut. Here's how to fix it:

1. **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Search for **"Forge"** or **"Copy File Reference"**
3. Click the pencil icon next to "Copy File Reference"
4. Pick a new combo like `Ctrl+Shift+U` or `Alt+U`

**Common culprits:** Vim extensions, browser preview extensions, other developer tools.

### Nothing Gets Copied to Clipboard

Try these workarounds:

- Use Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copy File Reference"
- Use right-click menu → "Copy File Reference"
- Check if you're in a text file (extension won't work on images/binaries)
- Some systems have clipboard permission issues. Restart VS Code usually fixes this

### Terminal Not Opening or Forge Not Starting

**If "Start New Forge Session" doesn't work:**

1. Check that Forge is in your PATH. Run `which forge` (macOS/Linux) or `where forge` (Windows) in terminal
2. If using `npx`, the extension may not detect it. Install Forge globally: `npm install -g forgecode`
3. Try manually opening a terminal and running `forge` to see if there are any errors
4. Restart VS Code after installing Forge globally

**If file references aren't being pasted automatically:**

- Increase the `forge.pasteDelay` setting (try 7000-10000ms for slower machines)
- The default is 5000ms (5 seconds). If that's not enough, Forge may need more time to start
- Check that your terminal shell is compatible (bash, zsh, PowerShell work well)
- Try using `Ctrl+U` to copy the reference, then manually paste it into the Forge terminal

### Weird File Paths

Sometimes you'll see paths like `/workspaces/project/src/file.js` instead of normal ones.

**This is actually fine.** VS Code uses different path formats for remote development, containers, and workspace setups. Forge handles these correctly, so don't worry about how they look.

## Pro Tips

**Start small:** Reference one function, ask Forge about it, see how it responds. Then level up to multi-file references.

**Be selective:** Don't dump entire files unless you actually need context from the whole thing. Forge works better with focused references.

**Combine with descriptions:** `@[component.tsx:45:67] this validation logic isn't working with empty strings` gives Forge both code and context.

## Next Steps

You're ready to start using the extension! The goal isn't to reference every line of code. It's to give Forge just enough context to actually help with your specific situation.
