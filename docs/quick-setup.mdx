# Quick Setup

After [installing Forge](../installation) using npm or another method, you'll need to configure it to work with your AI provider of choice. This guide will walk you through the essential setup steps.

## Setting Up API Credentials

Forge requires an API key to access AI models. Follow these steps to set up your credentials:

1. Create a `.env` file in your home directory:

```bash
touch ~/.env
```

2. Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add your API key. Here's an example using Open Router (recommended):

```bash
# Your API key for accessing AI models
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<Enter your Open Router Key>
```

You can get an API key at [Open Router](https://openrouter.ai/).

## Supported AI Providers

Forge automatically detects and uses your API keys from environment variables. It checks for keys in the following priority order:

1. `FORGE_KEY` - Antinomy's provider (OpenAI-compatible)
2. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Open Router provider (aggregates multiple models)
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Official OpenAI provider
4. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Official Anthropic provider

To use a specific provider, set the corresponding environment variable in your `.env` file.

```bash
# Examples of different provider configurations (use only one)

# For Open Router (recommended, provides access to multiple models)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# For official OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# For official Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# For Antinomy's provider
FORGE_KEY=your_forge_key_here
```

## Starting Forge

Once you've set up your API credentials, you can start Forge by simply typing:

```bash
forge
```

This will launch Forge in its default configuration. You'll see a prompt where you can start entering your tasks.

## Basic Commands

Here are a few basic commands to get you started:

- Type your task in natural language and press Enter to execute
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel the current operation
- Press Ctrl+D to exit Forge
- Type `/help` to see a list of available commands
