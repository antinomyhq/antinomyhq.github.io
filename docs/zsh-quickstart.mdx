# ZSH Quick Start

Get Forge working in your ZSH shell in 4 simple steps. This guide will set up the core integration so you can use the `:` prefix to send prompts to Forge while keeping all your shell aliases, functions, and environment intact.

**What you'll be able to do:**

- Send prompts to Forge using `: your prompt here`
- Switch between agents like `:sage`, `:muse`, or `:forge`
- Manage conversations with `:new` and `:conversation`
- Keep using all your existing ZSH aliases and tools

**Time required:** Quick setup with just 4 essential steps.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Forge">
    [Install and set up Forge](/docs/installation) following the main installation guide.
    
    Choose either global installation via `npm` or `npx` usage. Remember your choice for the next step.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install fd and fzf">
    These tools are required for tab completion features like quick file tagging with `@filename<Tab>` and fuzzy agent selection with `:<Tab>`.

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install fd fzf

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt install fd-find fzf

    # Arch Linux
    sudo pacman -S fd fzf
    ```

    **Other platforms:** See our [ZSH Dependencies Installation Guide](/docs/fd-fzf-installation) for detailed instructions.

    **What you get:**

    - Quick file tagging: `: review @package<Tab>`
    - Fuzzy agent selection: `:<Tab>`

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure ZSH Integration">
    Add Forge ZSH integration to your shell configuration:

    If you installed Forge globally:
    ```bash
    # Add to ~/.zshrc
    export FORGE_BIN=forge
    source <($FORGE_BIN extension zsh)
    ```

    If you're using npx:
    ```bash
    # Add to ~/.zshrc
    export FORGE_BIN="npx forgecode"
    source <($FORGE_BIN extension zsh)
    ```

    Then reload your shell:
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Test that everything works:

    ```bash
    # Basic prompt
    : hello world

    # Check system info
    :info

    # Test tab completion
    : review @<Tab>
    ```

    You should see Forge responding to your prompts and tab completion working for file tagging. 🎉

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enhance Your Experience

The core setup above gives you full Forge functionality. These optional enhancements make the experience even better:

---

### Syntax Highlighting

Add color-coded prompts to make Forge commands visually distinct in your terminal.

Install the [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugin:

**Option 1: Package Manager**

```bash
# macOS
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Fedora
sudo dnf install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

**Option 2: Oh My Zsh**

```bash
# Clone to Oh My Zsh plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Add to plugins in ~/.zshrc (must be last plugin)
plugins=(... zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

**Option 3: Manual Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git

# Add to ~/.zshrc (must be at the end)
echo "source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
```

::::warning Important Loading Order
**zsh-syntax-highlighting must be sourced LAST** in your `.zshrc` file, after all other plugins and the Forge integration. This ensures proper highlighting of Forge prompts.
::::

---

### Autocomplete Suggestions

Get real-time autocomplete suggestions as you type, making it easier to repeat previous Forge commands.

Install the [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete) plugin:

**Option 1: Package Manager**

```bash
# macOS
brew install zsh-autocomplete

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S zsh-autocomplete

# Gentoo (Portage)
sudo emerge app-shells/zsh-autocomplete
```

After installing via package manager, add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source /path/to/zsh-autocomplete/zsh-autocomplete.plugin.zsh
```

The exact path may vary depending on your package manager and system.

**Option 2: Oh My Zsh**

```bash
# Clone to Oh My Zsh plugins directory
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autocomplete

# Add to plugins in ~/.zshrc (before zsh-syntax-highlighting)
plugins=(... zsh-autocomplete zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

**Option 3: Manual Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete.git ~/.zsh/zsh-autocomplete

# Add to ~/.zshrc (before zsh-syntax-highlighting)
source ~/.zsh/zsh-autocomplete/zsh-autocomplete.plugin.zsh
```

::::tip Optional Enhancement
This plugin is optional but highly recommended. It will show autocomplete suggestions as you type, making it easier to reuse previous Forge prompts and commands.
::::

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If `: command not found` appears:

1. Ensure you added the source line to `~/.zshrc`
2. Reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc` or `exec zsh`
3. Verify `FORGE_BIN` is set correctly: `echo $FORGE_BIN`
4. Check the path matches your installation method (global vs npx)

### File Tagging Doesn't Work

If `@filename<Tab>` does nothing:

1. Verify fd and fzf are installed correctly (see Step 2 in [Installation](#installation))
2. Reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc` or `exec zsh`
3. Check if fd is available: `which fd` (or `which fdfind` on Ubuntu/Debian)
4. Check if fzf is available: `which fzf`

You can still use full file paths manually:

```bash
: review the changes in @[src/components/Header.tsx]
```

### Syntax Highlighting Problems

If highlighting doesn't appear:

1. **Ensure zsh-syntax-highlighting is installed** (see [Syntax Highlighting](#optional-enhancements) above)

2. **Verify correct loading order in ~/.zshrc**:
   - Forge integration must be loaded BEFORE zsh-syntax-highlighting
   - zsh-syntax-highlighting must be the LAST plugin sourced

3. **Check if zsh-syntax-highlighting is loaded**:

   ```bash
   echo $ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_VERSION
   ```

   If this returns empty, the plugin isn't loaded.

4. **Ensure you're using ZSH (not bash)**: `echo $SHELL`
5. **Check that your terminal supports colors**: `echo $TERM`
6. **Try reloading**: `source ~/.zshrc`

### No agent has subscribed to the event

If you get "agent not found" errors:

1. Check your available agents by running `/agents` in a Forge session
2. Verify agent name spelling (case-sensitive)
3. Test with a basic command: `: list my current working directory and git status`

## Next Steps

- Explore [file tagging](/docs/file-tagging-guide) to efficiently reference files in your prompts
