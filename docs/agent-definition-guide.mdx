# Agent Definition Guide: Creating Custom AI Assistants

Create specialized AI assistants using simple markdown files. Define expert consultants for frontend development, security auditing, testing, or any specialized workflow without complex configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before creating custom agents, ensure you have:

- Forge installed and running
- Access to create directories in your home folder
- Basic familiarity with YAML syntax

## Key Concepts

- **Agent**: A specialized AI assistant with predefined knowledge, behavior, and tool access - like having expert consultants for different development tasks.

- **Agent Definition File**: A markdown file containing YAML configuration (frontmatter) and an optional system prompt that defines the agent's expertise.

- **System Prompt**: The markdown content below the YAML frontmatter that defines the agent's personality, expertise, and behavior.

- **Tools**: Specific capabilities an agent can use, such as reading files, running shell commands, or searching code.

## Quick Start: Create Your First Agent

Follow these steps to create and use a custom agent in under 5 minutes:

### Step 1: Create the agents directory

You can create the agents directory in two locations:

#### Option 1: User Configuration (Recommended)
*Create once, use everywhere - these agents will be available across all your Forge sessions and projects.*

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/forge/agents
ls -la ~/forge/agents # Verify directory was created
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\forge\agents"
dir "%USERPROFILE%\forge\agents"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\forge\agents" -Force
Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\forge\agents"
```

#### Option 2: Local Configuration
*Higher priority - local agents override user agents with the same ID.*

Create the directory where Forge is running (current project directory):

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p .forge/agents
ls -la .forge/agents # Verify directory was created
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
mkdir ".forge\agents"
dir ".forge\agents"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".forge\agents" -Force
Get-ChildItem ".forge\agents"
```

**Note**: When creating in your project directory, the folder **must** be named `.forge/agents` (with the dot prefix).

### Step 2: Create your agent definition file

Create a file named `frontend-expert.md` in your chosen agents directory:
- **Global**: `~/forge/agents/frontend-expert.md`
- **Project specific**: `.forge/agents/frontend-expert.md`

**Note**: Local agents take priority - when Forge runs in a directory containing `.forge/agents/`, any agents there will override user agents with the same ID.

Add this content to the file:

```markdown
---
id: frontend-expert
title: Frontend Development Expert
description: React, TypeScript, and modern frontend specialist
---

You are a frontend development expert specializing in React and TypeScript.

Focus on writing clean, maintainable code with proper TypeScript interfaces, accessibility attributes, and comprehensive testing using React Testing Library.

Always explain your architectural decisions and provide working examples.
```

### Step 3: Restart Forge and select your agent

1. Restart Forge to load the new agent
2. Use the `/agent` command to view available agents
3. Select "FRONTEND_EXPERT" (id: `frontend-expert`) from the agent list
4. Your custom agent is now active and ready to use

## Agent File Structure

Every agent definition file follows this structure:

```markdown
---
# YAML Configuration (frontmatter)
id: unique-identifier
title: Human Readable Name
description: Brief description of capabilities
# Additional configuration options...
---

Your system prompt content goes here as regular markdown.
This section defines the agent's personality, expertise, and specific instructions.
```

## Configuration Reference

### Required Configuration

Only one field is mandatory:

```yaml
---
id: unique-agent-identifier
---
```

### Recommended Minimum Configuration

For a functional agent that can be used as a tool by other agents:

```yaml
---
id: unique-agent-identifier
title: Human Readable Agent Name
description: Brief description of agent capabilities
---
```

:::info
**Tool Compatibility**: Agents without a `description` field cannot be used as tools by other agents. Always include a description for maximum compatibility.
:::

### Configuration Examples

**Minimal agent** (just needs an ID):
```yaml
---
id: my-agent
---
```

**Practical agent** (recommended for most use cases):
```yaml
---

## Validation Rules and Constraints

Forge validates all agent definitions during startup. Invalid agents are skipped with warning messages in the logs.

### Validation Requirements

- **Unique IDs**: Each agent must have a unique `id` field across all agent files
- **Valid YAML**: Frontmatter must be properly formatted YAML syntax
- **Recognized Tools**: Only supported tools are allowed in the `tools` array
- **Parameter Ranges**: All numeric parameters must be within valid ranges

### Parameter Constraints

| Parameter                    | Valid Range   | Default | Notes                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `id`                         | Required      | -       | Must be unique across all agents        |

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

Agents can be placed in one of two locations:

#### Option 1: User Configuration
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/forge/agents/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\forge\agents\`
- Available across all projects and Forge sessions

#### Option 2: Local Configuration
- **All platforms**: `.forge/agents/` (in your project root)
- **Note**: Must use dot prefix (`.forge`) for local directories
- Higher priority - overrides user agents with same ID

Example organization:

**User Configuration:**
```
~/forge/agents/
├── frontend-expert.md
├── backend-expert.md
├── testing-expert.md
├── security-auditor.md
├── code-reviewer.md
├── devops-expert.md
└── data-engineer.md
```

**Local Configuration:**
```
your-project/
├── .forge/
│   └── agents/
│       ├── project-frontend.md
│       ├── custom-backend.md
│       └── team-reviewer.md
├── src/
└── package.json
```

:::warning
**Important**:
- Subdirectories are not supported. All agent definition files must be placed directly in the `agents` directory root. Files in subdirectories will not be discovered by Forge.
- For project-specific agents, the directory **must** be named `.forge/agents/` (with dot prefix).
:::

### Automatic Discovery

Forge automatically discovers and loads all `.md` files in your agents directory when starting up. Loaded agents become available in the agent selection interface when using the `/agent` command.

## Customizing Built-in Agents

Need Forge's built-in agents to understand your specific project? Instead of starting from scratch, customize the existing Forge, Muse, Sage, Parker, or Prime agents to match your coding standards, tech stack, and team preferences.

### Available Built-in Agents

- **Forge** - Full execution agent for implementing changes
- **Muse** - Planning and analysis agent for exploring solutions
- **Sage** - Research agent for deep investigation and analysis
- **Parker** - Code review and quality assurance agent
- **Prime** - General-purpose assistant agent

### How Agent Customization Works

When Forge loads an agent, it follows this priority order:

1. **Custom configuration** (any `.md` file in `.forge/agents/` with matching `id`) - highest priority
2. **Default configuration** (built into Forge) - fallback

**Key Point**: The filename doesn't matter - only the `id` field in the YAML frontmatter must match the built-in agent name you want to override.

For example:
- To customize the Forge agent: create any `.md` file with `id: "forge"`
- To customize the Sage agent: create any `.md` file with `id: "sage"`
- To customize the Muse agent: create any `.md` file with `id: "muse"`

This means your custom agent configurations will always take precedence over the built-in defaults.

### Setting Up Agent Customization

You can create the agents directory in two locations:

#### Option 1: Local Configuration (Recommended)
Create the agents directory in your current project directory. **Important**: The directory must be named `.forge/agents/` (with the dot prefix):

```bash
mkdir -p .forge/agents
```

#### Option 2: User Configuration
Create the agents directory in your user profile. **Note**: No dot prefix required for the user directory:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/forge/agents
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\forge\agents"
```

Create a markdown file for each agent you want to customize. The filename can be anything, but the `id` field in the YAML frontmatter must match the built-in agent name (forge, muse, sage, parker, or prime).

### Agent Customization Example

Here's how to customize the Forge agent for your project. Create a file named `my-custom-forge.md` (or any name you prefer) in `.forge/agents/`:

```markdown
---
id: "forge"
title: "Project Specific Forge"
description: "Forge agent customized for React TypeScript development with our team standards"
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - read
  - write
  - patch
  - shell
---

You are a specialized development assistant for our React TypeScript project.

## Project Standards:

1. **TypeScript**: Use strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
2. **React**: Prefer functional components with hooks
3. **Testing**: Include unit tests for all new components and functions
4. **Styling**: Use CSS modules with semantic class names
5. **Performance**: Always consider Core Web Vitals and optimization

## Code Quality Requirements:

- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow our ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

Focus on maintainable, performant code that follows our established patterns.
```

### Why Customize Built-in Agents?

Customizing built-in agents allows you to:

- **Match project standards** - Embed your team's coding conventions and best practices
- **Optimize for your stack** - Configure agents to understand your specific technologies and frameworks
- **Enforce quality gates** - Build in requirements for testing, documentation, and code quality
- **Streamline workflows** - Create agents that follow your established development processes
- **Maintain consistency** - Ensure all team members get consistent guidance and assistance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Agent not appearing in selection list

**Solutions**:

1. Verify the file is in the correct directory:
   - Global: `~/forge/agents/` or `%USERPROFILE%\forge\agents\`
   - Project specific: `.forge/agents/` (with dot prefix)
2. Ensure the file has a `.md` extension
3. Check that the YAML frontmatter is valid
4. Confirm the `id` field exists and is unique
5. Restart Forge to reload agents

**Problem**: "Invalid YAML" error messages

**Solutions**:

1. Validate YAML syntax using an online YAML validator
2. Check proper indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
3. Quote strings containing special characters
4. Use `|` for multiline strings with preserved line breaks
5. Use `>` for multiline strings with folded line breaks

**Problem**: Agent validation warnings

**Solutions**:

1. Check parameter values are within valid ranges (see constraints table)
2. Verify all tools in the `tools` array are recognized
3. Ensure `reasoning.max_tokens` is greater than 1024 and less than `max_tokens`
4. Add a `description` field if the agent will be used as a tool

**Problem**: Agent not behaving as expected

**Solutions**:

1. Review system prompt for clarity and specificity
2. Adjust `temperature` value (lower for more consistent responses)
3. Make `custom_rules` more specific and actionable
4. Verify appropriate tools are included for desired functionality
5. Check that the model supports the requested features

### Debugging Steps

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal configuration and add complexity gradually
2. **Check Startup Logs**: Look for validation warnings when Forge starts
3. **Test Incrementally**: Add one configuration option at a time
4. **Validate YAML**: Use online YAML validators to check syntax
5. **Use Working Examples**: Copy working examples and modify rather than starting from scratch

### Error Message Examples

Common validation errors and their meanings:

- `"Agent with id 'example' already exists"` - Duplicate agent ID found
- `"Invalid temperature value: 3.0"` - Temperature outside valid range (0.0-2.0)
- `"Unknown tool: invalid_tool"` - Tool name not recognized
- `"reasoning.max_tokens must be greater than 1024"` - Reasoning tokens too low

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective System Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Define clear responsibilities and focus areas
2. **Include Examples**: Show the type of output you expect
3. **Set Boundaries**: Specify what the agent should and shouldn't do
4. **Use Structure**: Organize instructions with headers and lists
5. **Test Iteratively**: Refine prompts based on agent behavior

### Configuration Tips

1. **Start Conservative**: Use lower temperature values for consistent behavior
2. **Limit Tools**: Only include tools the agent actually needs
3. **Set Appropriate Limits**: Configure `max_turns` based on expected conversation length
4. **Use Custom Rules**: Add specific guidelines for your project or team
5. **Enable Reasoning**: Use reasoning mode for complex problem-solving agents

### Team Collaboration

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent agent IDs and titles
2. **Document Purpose**: Write clear descriptions explaining each agent's role
3. **Share Configurations**: Version control agent definitions with your project
4. **Establish Conventions**: Create team standards for agent organization
5. **Regular Review**: Update agents as project requirements evolve

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Agents

Create specialized agents for different deployment environments:

```markdown
---

```

### Model-Specific Optimization

Different models may work better with different configurations:

```yaml
# For creative tasks (Claude)
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 0.9

# For precise technical tasks
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
temperature: 0.1
top_p: 0.8

# For reasoning-heavy tasks
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
temperature: 0.2
reasoning: true
```
