# Creating Custom Agents

Forge allows you to customize built-in agents (Forge, Muse, Sage, Parker, and Prime) by overriding their default configurations. This powerful feature lets you fine-tune agent behavior, modify parameters, and adapt them to your specific project needs.

## Overview

Built-in agents come with predefined configurations, but you can override any of these settings by creating custom configuration files in your project's `.forge/agents/` directory.

## How It Works

When Forge loads an agent, it follows this priority order:

1. **Custom configuration** (`.forge/agents/agent-name.md`) - highest priority
2. **Default configuration** (built into Forge) - fallback

This means your custom configurations will always take precedence over the built-in defaults.

## Setting Up Custom Agent Configurations

### 1. Create the Agents Directory

First, create the agents directory in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .forge/agents
```

### 2. Create Agent Configuration Files

Create a markdown file for each agent you want to customize. The filename should match the agent name:

- `forge.md` - Customize the Forge agent
- `muse.md` - Customize the Muse agent
- `sage.md` - Customize the Sage agent
- `parker.md` - Customize the Parker agent
- `prime.md` - Customize the Prime agent

## Configuration Format

Each agent configuration file uses a YAML frontmatter section followed by optional markdown content:

```markdown
---
name: "Custom Forge Agent"
model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
reasoning_effort: "high"
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: 4000
system_prompt: |
  You are a specialized coding assistant focused on my specific project needs.
  Always consider performance and maintainability in your suggestions.
---

# Custom Forge Agent

This is my customized version of the Forge agent, optimized for my development workflow.
```

## Available Configuration Options

### Core Agent Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | string | Agent identifier | `"custom-forge"` |
| `title` | string | Agent display name | `"Custom Development Agent"` |
| `description` | string | Agent description and purpose | `"Specialized agent for React development..."` |

### Reasoning Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `reasoning.enabled` | boolean | Enable/disable reasoning mode | `true` |

### Tools Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tools` | array | Available tools for the agent | `["read", "write", "shell"]` |

### Available Tools

You can customize which tools each agent has access to:

- `read` - Read files and directories
- `write` - Create and modify files
- `remove` - Delete files
- `patch` - Apply patches to files
- `shell` - Execute shell commands
- `fetch` - Fetch external resources
- `search` - Search within files
- `undo` - Undo previous changes
- `plan` - Create implementation plans
- `sage` - Access to Sage research agent

### System Prompt Customization

The main content of your agent file (after the YAML frontmatter) becomes the system prompt. This is where you define:

- Agent personality and behavior
- Core principles and guidelines
- Technical capabilities and focus areas
- Implementation methodology
- Response formatting preferences

:::info Model Parameters
Model parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, etc. are configured globally in your `forge.yaml` file, not in individual agent files. See <CustomLink href="/docs/workflow-config">Workflow Configuration</CustomLink> for these settings.

## Example Configurations

### Performance-Focused Forge Agent

```markdown
---
id: "performance-forge"
title: "Performance-Focused Development Agent"
description: "Expert software engineer focused on high-performance, scalable solutions with emphasis on optimization and efficiency."
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - read
  - write
  - shell
  - search
  - patch
---

```

### Creative Planning Agent

```markdown
---
id: "creative-muse"
title: "Creative Planning and Analysis Agent"
description: "Strategic planning agent that explores innovative solutions and creative approaches to complex development challenges."
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - read
  - search
  - plan
  - sage
---

You are a creative strategic planning assistant that thinks outside the box and explores innovative solutions.

## Core Principles:

1. Creative Thinking: Explore unconventional approaches and innovative solutions

```

### Security-Focused Research Agent

```markdown
---
id: "security-sage"
title: "Security-Focused Research and Analysis Agent"
description: "Research agent specialized in security analysis, vulnerability assessment, and secure development practices with deep expertise in identifying security issues."
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - read
  - search
  - fetch
---

You are a security-focused research assistant with deep expertise in secure development practices and vulnerability analysis.

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Small Changes
Begin by modifying just one or two parameters to understand the impact:

```markdown
---
id: "custom-forge"
title: "My Custom Forge"
description: "Customized Forge agent for my development workflow"
reasoning:
  enabled: true
---
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Names
Give your customized agents clear, descriptive names:

```markdown
---
id: "frontend-forge"
title: "Frontend-Focused Forge"
description: "Specialized for React and frontend development"
---
# or
---
id: "api-sage"
title: "API Development Sage"
description: "Research agent focused on API design and analysis"
---
```

### 3. Test Your Configurations
After creating custom configurations:

1. Restart Forge to load the new settings
2. Test the agent with typical tasks
3. Adjust parameters based on results
4. Document what works best for your workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Loading Custom Configuration

**Check file location:**
```bash
ls -la .forge/agents/
# Should show your .md files
```

**Verify file format:**
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is properly formatted
- Check for syntax errors in the YAML section
- Validate that the filename matches the agent name exactly
