# Windows Runtime Issues

This guide helps you resolve common Windows runtime errors that may occur when running Forge or its dependencies on Windows systems.

## Missing vcruntime140.dll Error

If you encounter the error **"The program can't start because vcruntime140.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem."**, this indicates that your system is missing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages.

### What is vcruntime140.dll?

The `vcruntime140.dll` file is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022. This library contains essential runtime components required by many applications built with Microsoft Visual C++, including some Node.js native modules that Forge may depend on.

### Solution: Install Visual C++ Redistributable

The recommended solution is to download and install the appropriate Visual C++ Redistributable package for your system architecture.

#### Step 1: Determine Your System Architecture

First, identify whether you're running a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) version of Windows:

1. Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog
2. Type `msinfo32` and press Enter
3. Look for "System Type" in the System Information window:
   - **x64-based PC**: You have a 64-bit system
   - **x86-based PC**: You have a 32-bit system

#### Step 2: Download the Correct Redistributable

Visit the official Microsoft download page:

**[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)**

Download the appropriate version for your system:

- **For 64-bit Windows**: Download `vc_redist.x64.exe`
- **For 32-bit Windows**: Download `vc_redist.x86.exe`
- **For ARM64 Windows**: Download `vc_redist.arm64.exe`

  <span>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you're unsure about your architecture, it's safe to install both x86 and x64 versions. 
    The x64 version includes both 64-bit and 32-bit libraries, but installing both ensures maximum compatibility.

#### Step 3: Install the Redistributable

1. **Run as Administrator**: Right-click the downloaded file and select "Run as administrator"
2. **Accept the License**: Read and accept the Microsoft Software License Terms
3. **Complete Installation**: Click "Install" and wait for the process to complete
4. **Restart if Required**: Restart your computer if prompted

#### Step 4: Verify the Installation

After installation, try running Forge again:

```bash
forge --version
```
