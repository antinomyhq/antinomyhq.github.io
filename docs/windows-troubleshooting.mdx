If you are on Windows and `forge` fails to run, you might have an error about a missing `vcruntime140.dll`. This usually means your system is missing an essential runtime library from Microsoft.

The `vcruntime140.dll` file is part of the **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**, which is required to run many applications, including some of Forge's dependencies.

## Solution: Install the Visual C++ Redistributable

The solution is to download and install the official package from Microsoft.

### Step 1: Determine Your System Architecture

First, identify your Windows system architecture:

1.  Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.
2.  Type `msinfo32` and press Enter.
3.  In the System Information window, find the "System Type". It will tell you if you have an **x64**, **x86**, or **ARM64** based PC.

### Step 2: Download the Correct Redistributable

Visit the official Microsoft download page:

**[Latest Supported Visual C++ Redistributable Downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)**

Download the correct file(s) for your system:

- **For x64-based PC**: Download `vc_redist.x64.exe`
- **For x86-based PC**: Download `vc_redist.x86.exe`
- **For ARM64-based PC**: Download `vc_redist.arm64.exe`

    <strong>Tip:</strong> A 64-bit Windows installation can run both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. To ensure maximum
    compatibility, it is recommended to install both the `x64` and `x86` redistributables on a 64-bit system.

### Step 3: Install the Redistributable

1.  **Run as Administrator**: Right-click the downloaded file(s) and select "Run as administrator".
2.  **Accept the License**: Agree to the license terms and click "Install".
3.  **Restart if Required**: Restart your computer if prompted after installation.

### Step 4: Verify the Fix

Return to the command prompt or application where you first saw the error and try running the command again. For example, if you were trying to run `forge --version`, try it again in the same terminal.

If the error is gone, you've fixed the problem!
