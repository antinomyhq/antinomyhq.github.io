# ZSH Dependencies Installation

This guide provides platform-specific installation instructions for the dependencies required by [ZSH Support](/docs/zsh-support):

- **zsh-syntax-highlighting** (required) - Provides syntax highlighting for Forge prompts
- **fd** (optional) - Fast file finder for `@filename<Tab>` file tagging
- **fzf** (optional) - Fuzzy finder for interactive file and agent selection

:::info Requirements Overview

- **zsh-syntax-highlighting**: Required for syntax highlighting feature
- **fd + fzf**: Optional but recommended for fuzzy file finding and agent selection
- Without these tools, you'll need to type full file paths manually and won't get syntax highlighting
  :::

## Install zsh-syntax-highlighting (Required)

[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) provides syntax highlighting for Forge prompts and is **required** for the advertised syntax highlighting feature.

### Package Manager Installation (Recommended)

#### macOS

```bash
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### Other Linux Distributions

Check the [official installation guide](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for distribution-specific instructions.

### Oh My Zsh Installation

If you use Oh My Zsh:

```bash
# Clone to Oh My Zsh plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Add to plugins in ~/.zshrc (must be last plugin)
plugins=(... zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

### Manual Installation

For manual installation without a package manager:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git

# Add to ~/.zshrc (must be at the end)
echo "source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
```

### Verify zsh-syntax-highlighting Installation

```bash
# Check if the environment variable is set
echo $ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_VERSION
```

If this returns a version number, the plugin is loaded correctly.

## Install fd (Fast File Finder)

`fd` is a fast and user-friendly alternative to the traditional `find` command, used by ZSH Support to quickly locate files in your project.

### macOS

```bash
brew install fd
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install fd-find
```

:::tip Ubuntu/Debian Note
On Ubuntu/Debian systems, the binary is installed as `fdfind` instead of `fd` due to a naming conflict. The ZSH integration handles this automatically.
:::

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S fd
```

### Other Linux Distributions

**Using cargo (if Rust is installed):**

```bash
cargo install fd-find
```

**Manual installation from GitHub releases:**

1. Visit [fd releases page](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases)
2. Download the appropriate binary for your system
3. Extract and place in your PATH

### Verify fd Installation

```bash
fd --version
```

## Install fzf (Fuzzy Finder)

`fzf` is a command-line fuzzy finder that provides the interactive file selection interface in ZSH Support.

### macOS

```bash
brew install fzf
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install fzf
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S fzf
```

### Other Linux Distributions

**Manual installation using git:**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
```

**Using package managers:**

- **CentOS/RHEL/Fedora**: `sudo dnf install fzf` or `sudo yum install fzf`
- **openSUSE**: `sudo zypper install fzf`

### Verify fzf Installation

```bash
fzf --version
```

## Configuration and Loading Order

:::warning Critical Loading Order
::::warning Critical Loading Order
The order in which you load these components in your `.zshrc` file is crucial:

1. **All other plugins** (git, auto-completion, etc.)
2. **Forge integration**: `source <(forge extension zsh)`
3. **zsh-syntax-highlighting**: Must be **LAST**

**Example ~/.zshrc structure:**

```bash
# Other plugins and configuration
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions)

# Forge integration
export FORGE_BIN=forge
forge() { ${=FORGE_BIN} "$@" }
source <(forge extension zsh)

# zsh-syntax-highlighting (must be last)
source /usr/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh # Linux
# source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh  # macOS
```

::::

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found After Installation

If `fd` or `fzf` commands are not found after installation:

1. **Check if they're in your PATH:**

   ```bash
   which fd fzf
   ```

2. **Restart your terminal** or reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **For Ubuntu/Debian fd issues:** The binary might be installed as `fdfind`. Create a symlink:
   ```bash
   ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd
   ```

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors during installation:

- **Avoid using `sudo` with `cargo install`** - this can create permission issues
- **Use a package manager instead** when available
- **For manual installations**, ensure the binary is placed in a directory you own (like `~/.local/bin`)

### Syntax Highlighting Not Working

If Forge prompts don't show syntax highlighting:

1. **Verify zsh-syntax-highlighting is installed**:

   ```bash
   echo $ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_VERSION
   ```

2. **Check loading order** in `.zshrc` - ensure zsh-syntax-highlighting is loaded last

3. **Verify the source path** is correct for your installation method

### ZSH Support Still Not Working

After installing all dependencies, if ZSH Support features don't work:

1. **Verify all tools are installed:**

   ```bash
   # For syntax highlighting
   echo $ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_VERSION
   
   # For file tagging (optional)
   fd --version && fzf --version
   ```

2. **Reload ZSH configuration:**

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Test the integration:**

   ```bash
   : test file tagging @package.json<Tab>
   ```

4. **Check the [ZSH Support troubleshooting section](/docs/zsh-support#troubleshooting)** for additional help.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Homebrew installation is the most reliable method
- Both tools integrate seamlessly with the system PATH

### Linux

- Most modern distributions include both tools in their repositories
- Ubuntu/Debian users should be aware of the `fdfind` vs `fd` naming

### Windows (WSL)

- Use the Linux installation methods within WSL
- Ensure your WSL distribution is up to date before installing

## Alternative Installation Methods

If the standard installation methods don't work for your system:

### Using Nix

```bash
nix-env -i fd fzf
```

### Using Snap (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo snap install fd fzf
```

### Building from Source

Both tools are written in Rust and can be built from source:

**fd:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/fd.git
cd fd
cargo build --release
```

**fzf:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git
cd fzf
make install
```

**zsh-syntax-highlighting:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
cd zsh-syntax-highlighting
# Follow manual installation instructions from the repository
```
