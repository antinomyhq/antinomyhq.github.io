# fd and fzf Installation

This guide provides platform-specific installation instructions for `fd` and `fzf`, which are required dependencies for [ZSH Support](/docs/zsh-support) file tagging functionality.

:::info Requirements
Both `fd` (fast file finder) and `fzf` (fuzzy finder) are required for the `@filename<Tab>` file tagging feature in ZSH Support. Without these tools, pressing Tab after `@` will not trigger the fuzzy finder, and you'll need to type full file paths manually.
:::

## Install fd (Fast File Finder)

`fd` is a fast and user-friendly alternative to the traditional `find` command, used by ZSH Support to quickly locate files in your project.

### macOS

```bash
brew install fd
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install fd-find
```

:::tip Ubuntu/Debian Note
On Ubuntu/Debian systems, the binary is installed as `fdfind` instead of `fd` due to a naming conflict. The ZSH integration handles this automatically.
:::

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S fd
```

### Other Linux Distributions

**Using cargo (if Rust is installed):**

```bash
cargo install fd-find
```

**Manual installation from GitHub releases:**

1. Visit [fd releases page](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases)
2. Download the appropriate binary for your system
3. Extract and place in your PATH

### Verify fd Installation

```bash
fd --version
```

## Install fzf (Fuzzy Finder)

`fzf` is a command-line fuzzy finder that provides the interactive file selection interface in ZSH Support.

### macOS

```bash
brew install fzf
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install fzf
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S fzf
```

### Other Linux Distributions

**Manual installation using git:**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
```

**Using package managers:**

- **CentOS/RHEL/Fedora**: `sudo dnf install fzf` or `sudo yum install fzf`
- **openSUSE**: `sudo zypper install fzf`

### Verify fzf Installation

```bash
fzf --version
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found After Installation

If `fd` or `fzf` commands are not found after installation:

1. **Check if they're in your PATH:**

   ```bash
   which fd fzf
   ```

2. **Restart your terminal** or reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **For Ubuntu/Debian fd issues:** The binary might be installed as `fdfind`. Create a symlink:
   ```bash
   ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd
   ```

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors during installation:

- **Avoid using `sudo` with `cargo install`** - this can create permission issues
- **Use a package manager instead** when available
- **For manual installations**, ensure the binary is placed in a directory you own (like `~/.local/bin`)

### ZSH Support Still Not Working

After installing both tools, if file tagging still doesn't work in ZSH Support:

1. **Verify both tools are installed:**

   ```bash
   fd --version && fzf --version
   ```

2. **Reload ZSH configuration:**

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Test the integration:**

   ```bash
   : test file tagging @package.json<Tab>
   ```

4. **Check the [ZSH Support troubleshooting section](/docs/zsh-support#troubleshooting)** for additional help.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Homebrew installation is the most reliable method
- Both tools integrate seamlessly with the system PATH

### Linux

- Most modern distributions include both tools in their repositories
- Ubuntu/Debian users should be aware of the `fdfind` vs `fd` naming

### Windows (WSL)

- Use the Linux installation methods within WSL
- Ensure your WSL distribution is up to date before installing

## Alternative Installation Methods

If the standard installation methods don't work for your system:

### Using Nix

```bash
nix-env -i fd fzf
```

### Using Snap (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo snap install fd fzf
```

### Building from Source

Both tools are written in Rust and can be built from source:

**fd:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/fd.git
cd fd
cargo build --release
```

**fzf:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git
cd fzf
make install
```
