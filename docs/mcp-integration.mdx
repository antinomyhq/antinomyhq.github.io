# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) feature allows AI agents to communicate with external tools and services, significantly extending Forge's capabilities. This implementation follows Anthropic's Model Context Protocol design, enabling seamless integration with various external systems and services.

## What is MCP?

MCP provides a standardized way for AI agents to interact with external tools, APIs, and services. Through MCP, Forge can:

- Access external APIs and web services
- Integrate with specialized tools and applications
- Perform web browser automation
- Connect to databases and data sources
- Interact with custom service endpoints

## MCP Configuration

### Using CLI Commands

Forge provides several CLI commands to manage MCP server configurations:

<details>
<summary><code>forge mcp list</code> - List all configured MCP servers</summary>

Displays all currently configured MCP servers with their basic information.

**Usage:**

```bash
forge mcp list
```

This command shows:

- Server names
- Connection status
- Basic configuration details

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>forge mcp add</code> - Add a new MCP server interactively</summary>

Launches an interactive setup process to add a new MCP server configuration.

**Usage:**

```bash
forge mcp add <server_name> <command/url>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>forge mcp add-json</code> - Add a server using JSON configuration</summary>

Adds an MCP server by providing a JSON configuration string.

**Usage:**

```bash
forge mcp add-json [OPTIONS] <NAME> <JSON>
```

**Arguments:**

- `<NAME>` - Name of the server
- `<JSON>` - JSON string containing the server configuration

**Options:**

- `-s, --scope <SCOPE>` - Configuration scope: `local` (default) or `user`

**Example:**

```bash
forge mcp add-json weather '{"command":"node","args":["weather.js"],"env":{"API_KEY":"abc123"}}'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>forge mcp get</code> - Get detailed server information</summary>

Retrieves detailed information about a specific MCP server configuration.

**Usage:**

```bash
forge mcp get <server_name>
```

This displays:

- Command/URL used by the mcp server

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>forge mcp remove</code> - Remove an MCP server</summary>

Removes an MCP server configuration.

**Usage:**

```bash
forge mcp remove <server_name>
```

This will permanently remove the server configuration.

</details>

### Manual Configuration

You can also manually create MCP configurations by creating a `.mcp.json` file. The file location determines its scope:

**Local Configuration (Project-Specific)**

- Location: `.mcp.json` in your project root directory
- Scope: Applies only to the current project
- Precedence: Takes precedence over global configuration

**Global Configuration (User-Specific)**

- Location: `.mcp.json` in your Forge configuration directory
- Scope: Applies to all projects
- Typical paths:
  - **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\forge\.mcp.json`
  - **macOS/Linux**: `~/forge/.mcp.json` or `~/.forge/.mcp.json`
- Equivalent to: `--scope user` in CLI commands
- Find your path: Run `/info` in Forge Shell to see your exact configuration directory

Create the file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser_automation": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-browser"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSER_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/bin/chromium-browser"
      }
    },
    "api_service": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server", "--port", "3001"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    },
    "webhook_server": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/events"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Structure

Each MCP server configuration can use one of two formats:

#### Command-based Server

```json
{
  "server_name": {
    "command": "command_to_execute",
    "args": ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"],
    "env": {
      "ENV_VAR": "value",
      "ANOTHER_VAR": "another_value"
    }
  }
}
```

#### URL-based Server

```json
{
  "server_name": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3000/events"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Precedence

MCP configurations are read from two locations in the following order of precedence:

1. **Local configuration** (project-specific): `.mcp.json` in your current project root directory
2. **Global configuration** (user-specific): `.mcp.json` in your Forge configuration directory

> **Note**: The configuration directory is automatically determined by Forge.
> You can always find the exact path by running `/info` in the Forge Shell.

Local configurations take precedence over global configurations, allowing you to have project-specific MCP setups while maintaining global defaults.

## How MCP Tools Work with Agents

Once you set up an MCP server, its tools automatically become available to all your agents. No extra configuration needed!

### How It Works

1. **Add MCP server** to your `.mcp.json` file
2. **Tools appear automatically** in all your agents
3. **Start using them** right away in any conversation

### Example Workflow

```json
// Configure weather MCP server in .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["weather-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "WEATHER_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Now any agent can use weather tools:
> /agent forge
> What's the weather like in San Francisco?

> /agent muse
> Get weather data for New York and create a summary
```

The `get_weather` tool is now available to all your agents automatically!

### What You Get

- **Works with every agent** - Forge, Muse, custom agents, all of them
- **No setup needed** - Just add the MCP server and you're done
- **Instant access** - Tools work immediately after configuration

### Verifying MCP Tools

To verify that your MCP server tools are available:

1. **List all tools**: Run `/tools` command in the Forge Shell
2. **Check MCP tools**: MCP tools are listed separately from built-in Forge tools
3. **Test the tool**: Ask an agent to use the tool in a conversation

Example:

```bash
> /tools
# Shows all available tools including MCP server tools

> /agent forge
> Use the weather tool to check San Francisco weather
# Agent will use the MCP tool if it's properly configured
```

## Example Use Cases

### Web Browser Automation

Configure an MCP server for browser automation to enable Forge to interact with web pages:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-browser"],
      "env": {
        "HEADLESS": "false",
        "VIEWPORT_WIDTH": "1920",
        "VIEWPORT_HEIGHT": "1080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Automated testing of web applications
- Data scraping and extraction
- Form filling and submission
- UI interaction testing

### External API Interactions

Set up MCP servers to interact with external APIs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather_api": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "weather_mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "WEATHER_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "DEFAULT_LOCATION": "San Francisco"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Fetching real-time data
- Integrating with third-party services
- Accessing specialized APIs
- Data synchronization

### Tool Integration

Connect specialized development tools through MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database_tools": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["database-mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "DB_CONNECTION_STRING": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db",
        "QUERY_TIMEOUT": "30000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Database query execution
- Schema management
- Data migration tools
- Performance monitoring

### Custom Service Connections

Create connections to custom internal services:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "internal_api": {
      "url": "http://internal-service.company.com/mcp",
      "env": {
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "internal_service_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Internal tool integration
- Custom workflow automation
- Proprietary system access
- Enterprise service connections

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables rather than in configuration files
- **Access Control**: Limit MCP server permissions to only what's necessary
- **Network Security**: Use secure connections (HTTPS) for URL-based servers
- **Credential Management**: Rotate API keys and tokens regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server Connection Failures:**

- Verify server URLs and ports are correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure required environment variables are set
- Validate authentication credentials
- Check if the MCP server process is running (for command-based servers)

**Command Execution Errors:**

- Verify command paths and arguments (e.g., `npx`, `node`, `python` are in PATH)
- Check file permissions for executable commands
- Ensure required dependencies are installed (e.g., `npm install` for Node.js servers)
- Review environment variable configurations
- Test the command manually in your terminal first

**Configuration Problems:**

- Validate JSON syntax in `.mcp.json` files
- Check file locations (project root vs. global config directory)
- Verify `mcpServers` key spelling
- Ensure command-based servers have `command` and `args` fields
- Ensure URL-based servers only have `url` field (no `env` field)

**Tools Not Appearing:**

- Run `/tools` to verify MCP tools are loaded
- Restart Forge after configuration changes
- Check logs using `/info` for MCP connection errors

**Debugging Tips:**

1. Use `/info` to find log directory and check for errors
2. Test MCP server commands manually in your terminal
3. Start with minimal configuration, add complexity gradually
4. Use `/tools` to confirm tools are available
