# Quickstart

Welcome to Forge! This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Forge for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have a code project to work with (or create a new one using forge).

## Step 1: Start your first session

Choose your preferred startup method:

**Navigate first (the traditional way):**

```bash
cd awesome-project
npx forgecode@latest
```

**Or start from anywhere (much nicer):**

```bash
npx forgecode@latest /path/to/your/project
```

This will run Forge. When you first run it, Forge will open your browser to [app.forgecode.dev](https://app.forgecode.dev/app) for authorization. Complete the OAuth process to authenticate.

You'll see the Forge prompt inside a new interactive session:

```

|  ___|__  _ __ __ _  ___
| |_ / _ \| '__/ _` |/ _ \
|  _| (_) | | | (_| |  __/
|_|  \___/|_|  \__, |\___|
               |___/

New conversation: /new
     Get started: /info, /usage, /help, /conversation
    Switch model: /model
    Switch agent: /forge or /muse or /agent
          Update: /update
            Quit: /exit or <CTRL+D>

> help me add a new feature
```

## Step 2: Understand your codebase

Let's start by having Forge analyze your project. Once the command is given, Forge will examine your project structure, dependencies, and patterns. Try one of these commands:

> **Analyze the architecture of this codebase and identify any potential issues**

> **What are the main components and how do they interact?**

> **Identify any code smells or areas that need refactoring**

> **Show me the data flow through this application**

> **What testing strategy is currently in place and how can it be improved?**

## Step 3: Make your first code change

Now let's have Forge write some code. Try a simple task:

> **Add a unit test for tree diffing function**

Forge will:

1. Identify the appropriate file
2. Make the edit

## Step 4: Use Git with Forge

Forge makes Git operations conversational and intelligent:

> **What files have I changed?**

> **Commit my changes with a descriptive message**

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

> **Create a new branch called feature/quickstart-demo**

> **Show me the last 5 commits**

> **Help me resolve any merge conflicts**

## Step 5: Debug and fix issues

Forge excels at debugging and problem-solving. Describe issues in natural language:

> **There's a bug where users can submit empty forms - help me fix it**

Or ask for help with specific errors:

> **I'm getting "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined" - what might be causing this?**

Forge will:

- Analyze the error context
- Identify potential causes
- Suggest multiple solutions
- Implement fixes with your approval

## What's next?

Now that you've learned the basics, explore more advanced features:
