# Tools Reference

Forge provides a comprehensive set of built-in tools that enable AI agents to interact with your system, manage files, process data, and communicate with users. This reference documents all available tools and their parameters.

> Note: These tools are used internally by Forge's AI agents and are not meant to be directly called by developers. This reference is provided for understanding what capabilities agents have access to within your system.

## Deprecation and Backward Compatibility

The tool names have been streamlined. Older names are still accepted for backward compatibility and will be deprecated in the future. Please migrate to the new names.

Deprecated → New
- forge_tool_fs_read → read
- forge_tool_fs_create → write
- forge_tool_fs_search → search
- forge_tool_fs_remove → remove
- forge_tool_fs_patch → patch
- forge_tool_fs_undo → undo
- forge_tool_process_shell → shell
- forge_tool_net_fetch → fetch
- forge_tool_followup → followup
- attempt_completion → attempt_completion
- forge_tool_plan_create → plan
