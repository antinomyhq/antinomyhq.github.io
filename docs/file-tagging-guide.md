# File Tagging with @: Your Guide to Better AI Context

One of the biggest challenges with AI coding assistants is providing the right context. Instead of copy-pasting code or Agent searching for where to start repeatedly, Forge's file tagging system lets you reference any project file with simple `@filename` syntax and tab completion.

This guide shows you how to use file tagging effectively - including when it works great and when it doesn't.

## How File Tagging Works

### The Basics

Reference any file in your project using `@` followed by part of the filename, then press **Tab** to activate autocomplete:

```
> Help me debug @auth [Tab]
```

You'll see matching files:

```
@[src/auth/AuthService.ts]
@[src/components/AuthForm.tsx]
@[tests/auth.test.ts]
```

**Real-time filtering**: Keep typing after Tab to narrow results:

```
> Help me debug @authser [continues filtering as you type]
```

Shows only:

```
@[src/auth/AuthService.ts]
```

Select your file using and complete the request:

```
> Help me debug @[src/auth/AuthService.ts] - the login method is throwing errors
```

### Multiple Files and Edge Cases

Reference multiple files:

```
> @[src/auth/AuthService.ts] @[src/types/User.ts] have a dependency issue
```

Files with spaces work fine:

```
> Review @[src/components/User Profile.tsx]
```

## When File Tagging Works Best

### Perfect Use Cases

**Code Review and Debugging**

```
> Review @[src/components/UserList.tsx] for performance issues
```

Better than pasting 100 lines of code because the AI sees your actual imports, dependencies, and context.

**Cross-File Problem Solving**

```
> @[src/auth/AuthService.ts] @[src/store/userStore.ts] user data isn't persisting after login
```

The AI can trace data flow between files instead of guessing from descriptions.

**Targeted Refactoring**

```
> Extract validation logic from @[src/components/ContactForm.tsx] into @[src/utils/validation.ts]
```

### When It Becomes a Pain

**Large Codebases (The Reality Check)**

In a project with 500+ files, typing `@user` might return:

```
@[src/components/UserProfile.tsx]
@[src/components/UserList.tsx]
@[src/components/UserCard.tsx]
@[src/services/UserService.ts]
@[src/types/User.ts]
@[src/hooks/useUser.ts]
@[src/utils/userHelpers.ts]
@[tests/user.test.ts]
@[tests/userService.test.ts]
@[src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx]
... and 23 more matches
```

**Solution strategies:**

- Be more specific: `@UserService` instead of `@user`
- Include directory: `@src/components/User`
- Use file extensions: `@user.test` for test files

**Performance Constraints**

File tagging hits limits with:

- **Binary files** - Automatically filtered out
- **Generated code** - Often in .gitignore anyway

**Monorepo Madness**

In monorepos, you might get:

```
> @config [Tab]
@[apps/web/config.ts]
@[apps/api/config.ts]
@[packages/shared/config.ts]
@[tools/build/config.js]
```

All different configs! You need to be more specific about which app/package you mean.

## Real-World Examples

### The Good: Precise Problem Solving

**Bug Investigation**

```
> @[src/components/LoginForm.tsx] shows "Invalid credentials" even with correct login. Check @[src/auth/AuthService.ts]
```

**Feature Implementation**

```
> Add dark mode support to @[src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx] and @[src/styles/theme.ts]
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Architecture Analysis (The Right Way)

**Instead of:** "Review my architecture"
**Do this:**

```
> Compare the data flow between @[src/services/ApiService.ts] and @[src/store/userStore.ts] - are we handling errors consistently?
```

**Why it works:** Specific files, specific question, actionable feedback.

### Migration Planning

```
> I want to migrate @[src/legacy/UserManager.js] to TypeScript. What interfaces do I need based on @[src/types/User.ts]?
```

### Test-Driven Development

```
> @[src/auth.test.ts] is failing on line 45. Help me fix the implementation in @[src/auth/AuthService.ts]
```

### Image File Support

File tagging now supports image files for visual context:

```bash
# Tag images for UI component documentation
@button-states.png
@icon-library.svg
@user-flow-diagram.jpg

# Reference in discussions
"The button component shows different states in @[assets/button-states.png]"
"Check the user flow in @[docs/wireframes/user-journey.png] for context"
```

**Supported formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP

**Use cases:**

- UI component design reviews
- Visual debugging of layout issues
- Referencing mockups or wireframes
- Icon and asset discussions

## Technical Deep Dive

### How the File Discovery Actually Works

**The Algorithm:**

1. **Recursive directory scan** - Walks your project tree
2. **Gitignore respect** - Skips ignored files (thank god)
3. **Binary detection** - Filters out executables, etc.
4. **Size filtering** - Skips files > 50KB to avoid context overflow
5. **Real-time filtering** - Updates as you type after Tab

## Limitations (The Honest Truth)

### When File Tagging Fails You

**1. Generated Code**
Build outputs, compiled assets, auto-generated types - these pollute results and aren't useful anyway.

**2. Binary Dependencies**
PDFs, executables, and most binary files - filtered out automatically, but you can't reference them. **Exception: Image files** (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP) can be tagged and referenced for UI discussions, design reviews, or visual debugging.

**3. Dynamic Imports**
If your code uses dynamic imports or runtime file loading, file tagging won't help trace those relationships.

**4. Cross-Repository Dependencies**
File tagging only sees your current project. External packages and microservices are invisible.

## Troubleshooting Real Problems

### "I Can't Find My File"

**Check these in order:**

1. File exists and isn't in .gitignore
2. Try different search terms (`Service` vs `service`)
3. Check file size (> 50KB gets filtered)

### "Too Many Results"

**Narrow it down:**

- Add directory: `@src/auth/Service`
- Use extension: `@Service.ts`
- Be more specific: `@AuthService` not `@auth`

File tagging works best when you understand both its strengths and limitations. Start simple, learn your project's search patterns, and gradually tackle more complex scenarios.

The goal isn't to reference every file in your project - it's to give the AI just enough context to provide genuinely helpful, specific advice.
