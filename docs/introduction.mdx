# Introduction to Forge

Forge is your AI pair programming partner that lives in the terminal. Get instant coding assistance, debug complex issues, and accelerate your development workflow—all without leaving your command line.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# Install Forge
npm install -g @antinomyhq/forge

# Start your first session
forge

# Ask your first question
> Help me refactor this function to be more readable
```

That's it! Forge understands your codebase and provides intelligent assistance for any development task.

## Why Forge?

### <Rocket size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Lightning Fast**
Sub-50ms startup times mean you're never waiting for the tool. Forge is built for developers who value speed and efficiency.

### <Brain size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Context-Aware Intelligence**
Forge understands your entire project context—files, Git history, dependencies, and environment. No need to explain your codebase repeatedly.

### <Wrench size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Multi-Agent Architecture**
Switch between specialized AI agents:
- **Forge Agent**: Full execution mode for implementing changes
- **Muse Agent**: Analysis mode for planning and review without modifications

### <Shield size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Secure by Design**
Optional restricted shell mode protects your system while providing powerful AI assistance.

### <Link size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: 6}} /> **Seamless Integration**
Works with your existing tools and workflows. Combine with Git, npm, Docker, and any Unix command through pipes and redirections.

## What Can Forge Do?

### Code Development
- Write, refactor, and optimize code based on your specifications
- Generate comprehensive test suites for existing codebases
- Debug complex issues through systematic error analysis
- Review code and suggest improvements

### Project Management
- Analyze project structure and suggest architectural improvements
- Generate documentation and technical specifications
- Set up new projects with best practices
- Integrate with version control workflows

### Daily Workflows
- Execute complex multi-step development tasks
- Automate repetitive coding patterns
- Navigate and understand large codebases
- Troubleshoot environment and dependency issues

## Why Shell-Based?

Forge leverages the terminal environment rather than a web interface or IDE plugin because:

- **Rich Context**: Your shell session contains your complete development context
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Seamlessly combines with the powerful Unix tool ecosystem
- **Composability**: Follows Unix philosophy of combining specialized tools
- **Speed**: Direct system access without UI overhead

This approach enables Forge to fit into your existing workflow rather than requiring you to adapt to a new environment.

## Key Features

- **Advanced AI Coding Assistant**: Powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet for state-of-the-art capabilities
- **Natural Language Interface**: Communicate with your system using everyday language
- **Automatic Context Compaction**: Smart conversation history management for unlimited interactions
- **Rich Terminal Output**: Formatted markdown display for improved readability
- **Resilient Operations**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff for reliable execution
- **Fine-Tuned Agent Behavior**: Control creativity and determinism with temperature settings
- **MCP Integration**: Connect with external tools and services through Model Context Protocol
