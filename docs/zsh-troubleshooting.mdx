## Troubleshooting

#### Command Not Found

If `: command not found` appears:

1. Ensure you added the source line to `~/.zshrc`
2. Reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc` or `exec zsh`
3. Verify `FORGE_BIN` is set correctly: `echo $FORGE_BIN`
4. Check the path matches your installation method (global vs npx)

#### File Tagging Doesn't Work

If `@filename<Tab>` does nothing, fd and fzf are not installed. See [Step 3](#installation) or our [ZSH Dependencies Installation Guide](/docs/fd-fzf-installation).

You can still use full file paths manually:

```bash
: review the changes in @[src/components/Header.tsx]
```

#### Syntax Highlighting Problems

If highlighting doesn't appear:

1. **Ensure zsh-syntax-highlighting is installed**:

  ```bash
  # Check if installed via package manager
  brew list | grep zsh-syntax-highlighting # macOS
  dpkg -l | grep zsh-syntax-highlighting   # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```

2. **Verify correct loading order in ~/.zshrc**:
  - Forge integration must be loaded BEFORE zsh-syntax-highlighting
  - zsh-syntax-highlighting must be the LAST plugin sourced

3. **Check if zsh-syntax-highlighting is loaded**:

  ```bash
  echo $ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_VERSION
  ```

  If this returns empty, the plugin isn't loaded.

4. **Ensure you're using ZSH (not bash)**: `echo $SHELL`
5. **Check that your terminal supports colors**: `echo $TERM`
6. **Try reloading**: `source ~/.zshrc`

7. **For manual installations**, verify the path is correct:
  ```bash
  ls -la /path/to/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
  ```

#### No agent has subscribed to the event

If you get "agent not found" errors:

1. Check your available agents by running `/agents` in a Forge session
2. Verify agent name spelling (case-sensitive)
3. Test with a basic command: `: list my current working directory and git status`
