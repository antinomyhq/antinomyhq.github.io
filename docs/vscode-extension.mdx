# VS Code Extension: Add File or Code References Without the Typing

Instead of manually typing file paths, copying code snippets, or trying to describe where the problem is, the Forge VS Code extension lets you reference any code with a single keystroke: `Ctrl+U`.

This guide covers installation, usage, and best practices for getting the most out of the extension.


### The Basics

Select any code in VS Code and press `Ctrl+U` to copy a properly formatted reference. The extension automatically detects your selection and generates the right format:

![Forge VS Code Extension Demo](../static/blog/demo_vscode.gif)

**Format it gets copied:**
```
@[<filepath>:<line start>:<line end>]
```

**How selection works:**
- **No selection**: `@[path/to/file.js]` → References entire file
- **Single line**: `@[path/to/file.js:42:42]` → References line 42
- **Multiple lines**: `@[path/to/file.js:15:28]` → References lines 15-28

**Why this matters:** Forge can now see exactly what code you're talking about, with full context and precise line numbers. No more "that function around line 50 something."

### Alternative Ways to Copy References

**When `Ctrl+U` doesn't work or you prefer menus:**

- **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Copy File Reference"
- **Right-click Menu**: Select code → right-click → "Copy Forge Reference"

### Beyond Single Files: Multi-File References

**Compare implementations across files:**
```
> Compare these two approaches @[src/utils/oldMethod.js:15:45] @[src/utils/newMethod.js:20:50]
```

**Reference any file type:**
```
> Review this CSS @[src/styles/components.css:67:89]
> Debug this config @[webpack.config.js:23:45]
> Check this SQL @[database/migrations/001_users.sql:12:25]
```

**Why multi-file references work:** Forge can analyze relationships between files, spot inconsistencies, and suggest improvements that consider your entire codebase context.

## Installation

### What You Need

- **VS Code**: Version 1.102.0 or higher
- **Forge CLI**: Already installed and working ([Installation Guide](/docs/installation) if you need it)

### Install the Extension

**Option 1: VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)**
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac) to open Extensions
3. Search for **"Forge Code"**
4. Click **Install** on the official extension by ForgeCode

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
code --install-extension ForgeCode.forge-vscode
```

**Verify it worked:** Open any code file, select some text, press `Ctrl+U`. If something gets copied to your clipboard, you're ready to go.

**Official extension:** [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ForgeCode.forge-vscode)

## Real-World Usage Examples

### <Lightbulb size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Debugging Production Issues

**The scenario:** Your authentication is failing in production, but works locally.

```
> Help me debug this authentication function @[src/auth/AuthService.ts:45:67] - it works locally but fails in production
```

**Why this works:** Forge can see the exact code, understand the logic flow, and suggest environment-specific issues to check.

### <Target size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Code Reviews That Actually Help

**The scenario:** You're reviewing a pull request and spot a complex component that could be improved.

```
> Can you refactor this component to use hooks? @[components/UserProfile.tsx:12:89] Also suggest performance optimizations
```

**Why this works:** Instead of generic advice, Forge sees your specific component structure and suggests targeted improvements.

### <Zap size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Cross-File Problem Solving

**The scenario:** Your API returns data that doesn't match your TypeScript types, causing runtime errors.

```
> @[src/api/users.js:156:203] @[src/types/User.ts] have a type mismatch - the API returns 'user_id' but the type expects 'userId'
```

**Why this works:** Forge can compare both files simultaneously and suggest solutions that fix the mismatch properly.

### <FileText size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Feature Implementation

**The scenario:** You need to add dark mode support across multiple components.

```
> Add dark mode support to @[src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx:15:45] and update @[src/styles/theme.css:23:67] to work together
```

**Why this works:** Forge understands how your theme system works and can suggest consistent changes across files.


## Troubleshooting Guide

### "Extension Not Working At All"

**Symptoms:** Pressing `Ctrl+U` does nothing, no menu options appear.

**Fix these in order:**
1. **Check Forge CLI**: Run `forge --version` in terminal
   - If "command not found" → Install Forge first: [Installation Guide](/docs/installation)
2. **Check VS Code version**: Help → About → Must be 1.102.0 or higher
3. **Verify extension**: Extensions view → "Forge Code" should show "Installed" and "Enabled"
4. **Restart VS Code**: Close completely and reopen

### "Ctrl+U Doesn't Work"

**Symptoms:** The shortcut is taken by another extension or VS Code feature.

**Solution:**
1. **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Search for **"Forge"**
3. Click the pencil icon next to "Copy File Reference"
4. Press your preferred key combination (try `Ctrl+Shift+U` or `Alt+U`)

### "Nothing Gets Copied to Clipboard"

**Symptoms:** You press the shortcut but nothing appears when you paste.

**Try these solutions:**
- Use Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copy File Reference"
- Check if you're in a text file (not an image or binary file)
- Try the right-click menu → "Copy Forge Reference"
- Check if clipboard permissions are blocked

### "File Paths Look Weird"

**Symptoms:** Copied paths show `/workspaces/project/` or other unexpected prefixes.

**This is normal:** The extension copies paths exactly as VS Code sees them. This works correctly with Forge, even in:
- Remote development (SSH, containers, WSL)
- Workspace folders with different names
- Symlinked directories

## Next Steps

Start with single file references, then try multi-file references as you get comfortable with the workflow.
