# Skip the Copy-Paste: Reference Any Code Instantly

Tired of manually typing file paths and copying code snippets when asking Forge for help? This VS Code extension lets you reference any code with a single keystroke.

## What This Extension Does

**The problem:** Describing code problems is slow and unclear
- "That function around line 50 something..."
- Copy-pasting code snippets manually
- Typing out long file paths

**The solution:** Show Forge exactly what you mean
- Select any code â†’ Press `Ctrl+U` â†’ Get a perfect reference
- Works with single lines, code blocks, or entire files

:::info New to Forge?
This extension works with [Forge CLI](/docs/installation). If you haven't installed Forge yet, start with our [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

## See It in Action

![Forge VS Code Extension Demo](../static/blog/demo_vscode.gif)

**What you just saw:** Select code â†’ Press `Ctrl+U` â†’ Reference copied and ready to use with Forge.

## Installation

### What You Need
- **VS Code**: Version 1.102.0 or higher
- **Forge CLI**: [Install](/docs/installation) it first if you haven't already

### Install the Extension

**Option 1: VS Code Marketplace (Easiest)**
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Extensions panel)
3. Search for **"Forge Code"**
4. Click **Install** on the official ForgeCode extension

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
code --install-extension ForgeCode.forge-vscode
```

**Test it works:** Open any code file, select some text, press `Ctrl+U`. If something gets copied to your clipboard, you're ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

**Official extension:** [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ForgeCode.forge-vscode)

## Basic Usage

### The Core Workflow

1. **Select code** (or don't select anything for whole file)
2. **Press `Ctrl+U`** 
3. **Paste into Forge** conversation

That's it. No typing, no manual copying.

### What Gets Copied

**Format:** `@[<filepath>:<line start>:<line end>]`

**How selection works:**
- **No selection**: `@[path/to/file.js]` â†’ References entire file
- **Single line**: `@[path/to/file.js:42:42]` â†’ References line 42 only
- **Multiple lines**: `@[path/to/file.js:15:28]` â†’ References lines 15-28

**Multiple files:** Select files from different locations and copy them all at once:
```
> Compare these approaches @[src/utils/oldMethod.js:15:45] @[src/utils/newMethod.js:20:50]
> Review this component and its styles @[components/Button.tsx] @[styles/button.css:12:34]
```

**Key benefit:** Forge can now see exactly what code you're talking about, with full context and precise line numbers.

### Alternative Ways
- **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ type "Copy File Reference"
- **Right-click Menu**: Select code â†’ right-click â†’ "Copy Forge Reference"

## Real-World Examples

### <Lightbulb size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Debugging Issues

**Scenario:** Authentication fails in production but works locally.

```
> Help me debug this auth function @[src/auth/AuthService.ts:45:67] - works locally but fails in production
```

**Why this helps:** Forge sees the exact code and can suggest environment-specific issues to check.

### <Target size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Code Reviews

**Scenario:** You spot a component that could be improved.

```
> Can you refactor this component to use hooks? @[components/UserProfile.tsx:12:89] Also suggest performance optimizations
```

**Why this works:** Instead of generic advice, Forge sees your specific component and suggests targeted improvements.

### <Zap size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Type Mismatches

**Scenario:** API data doesn't match your TypeScript types.

```
> @[src/api/users.js:156:203] @[src/types/User.ts] have a type mismatch - API returns 'user_id' but type expects 'userId'
```

**Why this works:** Forge compares both files simultaneously and suggests proper fixes.

### <FileText size={20} style={{verticalAlign: 'baseline', marginRight: 6}} />Feature Implementation

**Scenario:** Adding dark mode across multiple components.

```
> Add dark mode support to @[src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx:15:45] and update @[src/styles/theme.css:23:67]
```

**Why this works:** Forge understands your theme system and suggests consistent changes across files.

## Troubleshooting

### "Extension Doesn't Respond At All"

**Check these in order:**
1. **Forge CLI installed?** â†’ Run `forge --version` in terminal
   - If "command not found" â†’ [Install Forge first](/docs/installation)
2. **VS Code version** â†’ Help â†’ About â†’ Need 1.102.0 or higher
3. **Extension enabled?** â†’ Extensions view â†’ "Forge Code" shows "Enabled"
4. **Restart VS Code** â†’ Close completely and reopen

### "Ctrl+U Shortcut Conflict"

**Solution:** Change the keyboard shortcut
1. **File â†’ Preferences â†’ Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Search for **"Forge"**
3. Click pencil icon next to "Copy File Reference"
4. Try `Ctrl+Shift+U` or `Alt+U` instead

### "Nothing Gets Copied"

**Try these fixes:**
- Use Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Copy File Reference"
- Make sure you're in a text file (not image/binary)
- Try right-click menu â†’ "Copy Forge Reference"
- Check clipboard permissions in your system

### "File Paths Look Strange"

**Example:** `/workspaces/project/src/file.js`

**This is normal:** The extension copies paths exactly as VS Code sees them. This works correctly with Forge, even in:
- Remote development
- Different workspace setups

## Quick Success Tips

### Start Simple
1. **Practice on one file first** â†’ Select a function, press `Ctrl+U`
2. **Test with Forge** â†’ Paste the reference and ask a simple question
3. **Try multi-file references** once comfortable

### Best Practices
- **Be specific with selections** â†’ Select the exact code you're asking about
- **Include context** â†’ Sometimes reference related files together
- **Don't reference everything** â†’ Only include code that's relevant to your question

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Selecting too much code at once (Forge works better with focused references)
- Forgetting to test that Forge CLI is working first
- Not using the extension because you think typing is faster (it's not!)

## Next Steps

**You're ready to:** Start using `Ctrl+U` for single file references, then experiment with multi-file references as you get comfortable.

**Remember:** The goal isn't to reference every line of code, it's to give Forge just enough context to provide genuinely helpful, specific advice for your exact situation.
