# Skip the Copy-Paste: Reference Any Code Instantly

Tired of manually typing file paths and copying code snippets when asking Forge for help? This VS Code extension lets you reference any code with a single keystroke.

## What This Extension Does

**The problem:** Describing code problems is slow and unclear
- "That function around line 50 something..."
- Copy-pasting code snippets manually
- Typing out long file paths

**The solution:** Show Forge exactly what you mean
- Select any code → Press `Ctrl+U` → Get a perfect reference
- Works with single lines, code blocks, or entire files

:::info Prerequisite: Forge CLI
This extension works with [Forge CLI](/docs/installation). Install that first if you haven't already.

## See It in Action

**What you just saw:** Select code → Press `Ctrl+U` → Reference copied and ready to use with Forge.

## Installation

### What You Need
- **VS Code**: Version 1.102.0 or higher
- **Forge CLI**: [Install](/docs/installation) it first if you haven't already

### Install the Extension

**Option 1: VS Code Marketplace (Easiest)**
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Extensions panel)
3. Search for **"Forge Code"**
4. Click **Install** on the official ForgeCode extension

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
code --install-extension ForgeCode.forge-vscode
```

**Test that it works:** Open any code file, select some text, press `Ctrl+U`. If something gets copied to your clipboard, you're ready to go!

**Official extension:** [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ForgeCode.forge-vscode)

## Basic Usage

### The Core Workflow

1. **Select code** (or don't select anything for whole file)
2. **Press `Ctrl+U`** 
3. **Paste into Forge** conversation

That's it. No typing, no manual copying.

### What Gets Copied

**Format:** `@[<filepath>:<line start>:<line end>]`

**How selection works:**
- **No selection**: `@[path/to/file.js]` → References entire file
- **Single line**: `@[path/to/file.js:42:42]` → References line 42 only
- **Multiple lines**: `@[path/to/file.js:15:28]` → References lines 15-28

### Power Move: Multi-File References

Here's the real power move. Select code from different files and copy them all at once:

```
> Compare these approaches @[src/utils/oldMethod.js:15:45] @[src/utils/newMethod.js:20:50]
> Review this component and its styles @[components/Button.tsx] @[styles/button.css:12:34]
```

Now Forge can see exactly what code you're talking about, with full context and precise line numbers. No more "that function around line 50 something" conversations.

### Alternative Ways to Copy
- **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Copy File Reference"
- **Right-click Menu**: Select code → right-click → "Copy File Reference"

## Real-World Examples

### Debugging Issues

**Scenario:** Authentication fails in production but works locally.

```
> Help me debug this auth function @[src/auth/AuthService.ts:45:67] - works locally but fails in production
```

Forge sees the exact code and can suggest environment-specific issues to check.

### Code Reviews

**Scenario:** You spot a component that could be improved.

```
> Can you refactor this component to use hooks? @[components/UserProfile.tsx:12:89] Also suggest performance optimizations
```

Instead of generic advice, Forge sees your specific component and suggests targeted improvements.

### Type Mismatches

**Scenario:** API data doesn't match your TypeScript types.

```
> @[src/api/users.js:156:203] @[src/types/User.ts] have a type mismatch - API returns 'user_id' but type expects 'userId'
```

Forge compares both files simultaneously and suggests proper fixes.

### Feature Implementation

**Scenario:** Adding dark mode across multiple components.

```
> Add dark mode support to @[src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx:15:45] and update @[src/styles/theme.css:23:67]
```

Forge understands your theme system and suggests consistent changes across files.

## When Things Don't Work

### Extension Completely Dead

**Quick fixes to try:**
1. Make sure Forge CLI is actually installed - run `forge --version` in terminal
2. Check your VS Code version (Help → About) - need 1.102.0+
3. Verify the extension is enabled in Extensions view
4. Restart VS Code completely

### Ctrl+U Does Nothing

This usually means another extension grabbed that shortcut. Here's how to fix it:

1. **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Search for **"Forge"**
3. Click the pencil next to "Copy File Reference"
4. Pick a new combo like `Ctrl+Shift+U` or `Alt+U`

Common culprits: Vim extensions, other developer tools that love Ctrl+U.

### Nothing Gets Copied to Clipboard

Try these workarounds:
- Use Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Copy File Reference"
- Right-click menu → "Copy File Reference" 
- Check if you're in a text file (extension won't work on images/binaries)
- Some systems have clipboard permission issues - restart VS Code usually fixes this

### Weird File Paths

Sometimes you'll see paths like `/workspaces/project/src/file.js` instead of normal ones.

**This is actually fine.** VS Code uses different path formats for remote development, containers, and workspace setups. Forge handles these correctly, so don't worry about how they look.

## Pro Tips

**Start small:** Reference one function, ask Forge about it, see how it responds. Then level up to multi-file references.

**Be selective:** Don't dump entire files unless you actually need context from the whole thing. Forge works better with focused references.

**Combine with descriptions:** `@[component.tsx:45:67] this validation logic isn't working with empty strings` gives Forge both code and context.

## Next Steps

You're ready to start using `Ctrl+U` everywhere. The goal isn't to reference every line of code - it's to give Forge just enough context to actually help with your specific situation.
