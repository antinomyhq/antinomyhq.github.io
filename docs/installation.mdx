# Installation & Setup

Get Forge running on your system in under 5 minutes. This guide covers installation, authentication setup, and project initialization.

## Install and authenticate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Forge">
    Install Forge using the official installation script:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://forgecode.dev/install.sh | sh
    ```

    This will install the `forge` command globally on your system.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Forge">
    Navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Forge">
    Run Forge:

    ```bash
    forge
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete authentication">
    Forge offers multiple authentication options:

    1. **Forge Provider**: The default option. Connect through the Forge app and complete the OAuth process.
       This will open your browser to [app.forgecode.dev](https://app.forgecode.dev/app/) where you can sign up or sign in with Google/GitHub.

    2. **Other AI Providers**: Configure Forge to use [OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers](/docs/custom-providers) with your own API keys for custom setups.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Initialize your project

After installing Forge, you can configure additional AI providers beyond the default. Follow the [Provider Configuration](../custom-providers) guide to set up alternative providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter.
