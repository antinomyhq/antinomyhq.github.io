# Custom Commands
## TL;DR

Create reusable AI command shortcuts in `forge.yaml` to eliminate repetitive prompting. Define a name, description, and prompt - then run with `/command-name`.

```yaml
commands:
  - name: test
    description: Generate unit tests for selected code
    prompt: Create comprehensive unit tests with edge cases
```

When using AI in development, teams often face the hassle of executing repetitive tasks, such as updating documentation or writing tests, which require detailed prompts each time. This repetitive process can be time-consuming.

Forgeâ€™s custom commands solve that: they allow you to create **pre-configured shortcuts** in your codebase with prompts that include all the necessary instructions.

## Configuring Custom Commands

Custom commands are defined in the commands section of your `forge.yaml` file.

Let's examine each property in the commands section:

### name (required)

The name property defines the command identifier that users will type to execute the command. For example, if name is set to "outdated-docs", users will run it by typing `/outdated-docs` in Forge.

```yaml
commands:
  - name: outdated-docs
```

### description (required)

This provides a brief explanation of what the command does. This description appears in help menus and command listings to help users understand the purpose of each command.

```yaml
commands:
  - name: outdated-docs
    description: Find all the outdated documentation in the codebase
```

### prompt (optional)

The prompt value that will be used when the command is executed.

```yaml
commands:
  - name: outdated-docs
    description: Find all the outdated documentation in the codebase
    prompt: Scan through all documentation files and identify content that appears outdated, references deprecated features, or contains information that conflicts with current implementations.
```

You can also set a default value to allow users to pass their own argument:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: outdated-docs
    description: Find all the outdated documentation in the codebase
    ## users can pass their own prompt this way
    prompt: |
        Scan through all documentation files and identify content that appears outdated, references deprecated features, or contains information that conflicts with current implementations.
```

this way the user can pass their own prompt:
```shell 
/outdated-docs go through each API reference in the documentation, and identify references that appear to be outdated or different in any way with their actual implementation
```

Start Forge:

Enter `/outdated-docs` to run the command:

## Trade-offs to Consider

Custom commands, if executed in a conversation, may cause the context to slowly get filled with the tasks carried out by the commands. This might influence the responses for other unrelated tasks in the future. To reduce this deviation:
- start a new conversation by running `/new`
- [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/antinomyhq/forge/issues/new) if you would like it to have a different behavior.

## Best Practices

### Good Examples

```yaml
commands:
  # Short, clear name that's easy to type
  - name: test
    description: Generate unit tests for the current file
    prompt: Create comprehensive unit tests with edge cases and mocks
  
  # Descriptive but concise
  - name: refactor
    description: Refactor selected code for better readability
    prompt: Improve code structure, naming, and remove duplication while preserving functionality
  
  # Specific use case with helpful context
  - name: api-docs
    description: Generate API documentation from code comments
    prompt: Create detailed API documentation including parameters, return values, and usage examples
```

### Bad Examples

```yaml
commands:
  # Too long and awkward to type, defies the whole purpose of custom commands
  - name: generate-comprehensive-unit-tests-for-current-file
    description: Tests
    prompt: Make tests
  
  # Vague description and useless prompt
  - name: thing
    description: Does stuff with code
    prompt: Do something good
  
  # Missing context - what kind of documentation?
  - name: docs
    description: Make docs
    prompt: Write documentation for this
```

### Key Guidelines

- **Names**: 1-2 words max, use hyphens for multiple words
- **Descriptions**: Be specific about what the command does and where it applies
- **Document your commands** in your team's README or wiki
