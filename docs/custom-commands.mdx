# Custom Commands

Forge allows you to define and use custom commands that extend its functionality and streamline your workflow. These commands can be executed within the Forge CLI using the `/command_name` syntax and are defined as individual files in the `~/forge/commands/` directory.

## What Are Custom Commands?

Custom commands are user-defined shortcuts that trigger specific actions or workflows. They enable you to:

- Create project-specific automation
- Standardize common workflows across your team
- Simplify complex operations into single commands
- Integrate Forge with your development processes

## Defining Custom Commands

Custom commands are defined as individual Markdown files in the `~/forge/commands/` directory. Each command file follows the naming convention `command-name.md`.

### Command File Structure

Create a Markdown file in `~/forge/commands/` with frontmatter containing metadata and the body containing the prompt:

**`~/forge/commands/rust-format.md`**

```markdown
---
name: rust-format
description: Format and lint Rust code using cargo fmt and clippy
---

- Run `cargo fmt` to format the code
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for common mistakes and improvements.
- Fix any issues found.
```

**`~/forge/commands/branch.md`**

```markdown
---
name: branch
description: Create and checkout a new branch
---

Create a new branch based on the current changes and checkout to it
```

**`~/forge/commands/check.md`**

```markdown
---
name: check
description: Checks if the code is ready to be committed
---

- Run the `lint` and `test` commands and verify if everything is fine.
  <lint>npm run lint</lint>
  <test>npm test</test>
- Fix every issue found in the process
```

### File Format

Command files use Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

- **Frontmatter**: Contains `name` and `description` fields enclosed in `---`
- **Body**: The content after frontmatter becomes the default prompt for the command

### Configuration Options

| Option        | Required | Location    | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Yes      | Frontmatter | The name of the command (used as `/name` in the CLI)     |
| `description` | Yes      | Frontmatter | A description of what the command does (shown in help)   |
| prompt        | No       | Body        | Default prompt value used when no arguments are provided |

:::warning Deprecated: Commands in forge.yaml
Defining commands in the `commands` section of `forge.yaml` is **deprecated** and no longer supported. Please migrate your commands to individual Markdown files in the `~/forge/commands/` directory.
:::

## Using Custom Commands

Once configured, you can use custom commands in the Forge CLI in two ways:

### Basic Command Execution

To execute a command with its default value (if provided):

```bash
/rust-format
```

This executes the `rust-format` command with the default instructions defined in its prompt.

### Command with Arguments

To override the default value or provide instructions for commands without a default:

```bash
/rust-format Also run cargo check to verify compilation
```

```bash
/branch feature/new-auth
```

## How Custom Commands Work

When a custom command is executed, it follows this event flow:

1. **Command Execution**: User types a command like `/rust-format Also run cargo check`
2. **Event Dispatch**: Forge dispatches an event with:
   - **Name**: The command name (e.g., `rust-format`)
   - **Value**: The provided argument or default value (e.g., `Also run cargo check`)
3. **Event Processing**: The agent processes the event according to its configuration

## Command Handling Approaches

There are two main approaches for handling custom command events in agents:

### 1. Using Event Value as Instructions

Pass the event value directly to the agent as complete instructions:

**`~/forge/commands/rust-format.md`**

```markdown
---
name: rust-format
description: Format and lint Rust code using cargo fmt and clippy
---

Run `cargo fmt` to format the code and `cargo clippy` to check for common mistakes and improvements. Fix any issues found.
```

### 2. Using Event Value as Data in a Template

Incorporate the event value into a structured template:

**`~/forge/commands/analyze.md`**

````markdown
---
name: analyze
description: Analyze a file with specific focus
---

Perform a detailed analysis of the specified file

## Example Custom Commands

### Git Workflow Commands

**`~/forge/commands/branch.md`**

```markdown
---
name: branch
description: Create and checkout a new branch from the current changes
---

Create a new branch based on the context and checkout to it
```

**`~/forge/commands/pr.md`**

```markdown
---
name: pr
description: Create a pull request for current branch
---

Create a detailed pull request description based on the changes in this branch
```

### Development Workflow Commands

**`~/forge/commands/review.md`**

```markdown
---
name: review
description: Review code for bugs and improvements
---

Review the code for bugs, security issues, performance problems, and suggest improvements
```

**`~/forge/commands/document.md`**

```markdown
---
name: document
description: Generate documentation for a file
---

Generate comprehensive documentation for the specified code
```

**`~/forge/commands/test.md`**

```markdown
---
name: test
description: Generate unit tests for a file or function
---

Create comprehensive unit tests with good coverage for the specified code
```

### Project-Specific Commands

**`~/forge/commands/fixme.md`**

```markdown
---
name: fixme
description: Looks for all the fixme comments in the code and attempts to fix them
---

Find all the FIXME comments in source-code files and attempt to fix them.
```

**`~/forge/commands/deploy.md`**

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Prepare deployment package and update version numbers
---

Update version numbers and prepare the project for deployment
```

## Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, action-oriented names for commands (use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word commands)
2. **Helpful Descriptions**: Write descriptions that explain both the purpose and expected outcome
3. **Default Prompts**: Provide default prompts for commands that can work without specific arguments
4. **Specialized Agents**: Configure agents specifically for handling particular commands in `~/forge/agents/`
5. **File Organization**: Keep command files organized in `~/forge/commands/` with descriptive filenames
6. **Documentation**: Document custom commands for your team in a project README

## Migrating from forge.yaml

If you have commands defined in your `forge.yaml` file, migrate them to individual Markdown files:

**Old format (deprecated):**

```yaml
# forge.yaml
commands:
  - name: rust-format
    description: Format and lint Rust code
    prompt: |
      Run cargo fmt and cargo clippy, then fix any issues
```

**New format:**

# In `~/forge/commands/rust-format.md`

```markdown
---
name: rust-format
description: Format and lint Rust code
---

Run cargo fmt and cargo clippy, then fix any issues
```

### Migration Steps

1. Create the `~/forge/commands/` directory if it doesn't exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/forge/commands
   ```

2. For each command in your `forge.yaml`, create a Markdown file:

   ```bash
   # Example: converting a rust-format command
   touch ~/forge/commands/rust-format.md
   ```

3. Add the frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields

4. Add the prompt as the body content (without `prompt:` prefix)

5. Remove the `commands` section from your `forge.yaml`

6. Restart Forge to load the new command definitions
