# Custom Commands

Forge allows you to define and use custom commands that extend its functionality and streamline your workflow. These commands can be executed within the Forge CLI using the `/command_name` syntax and are configured in your `forge.yaml` file.

## What Are Custom Commands?

Custom commands are user-defined shortcuts that trigger specific actions or workflows. They enable you to:

- Create project-specific automation
- Standardize common workflows across your team
- Simplify complex operations into single commands
- Integrate Forge with your development processes

## Configuring Custom Commands

Custom commands are defined in the `commands` section of your `forge.yaml` file:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: commit
    description: Commit changes with a standard prefix
    prompt: |
      Understand the diff produced and commit using the 'conventional commit' standard

  - name: branch
    description: Create and checkout a new branch

  - name: pull-request
    description: Create a pull request with standard template
    prompt: |
      Understand the diff with respect to `main` and create a pull-request.
      Ensure it follows 'conventional commit' standard.
```

### Configuration Options

| Option        | Required | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Yes      | The name of the command (used as `/name` in the CLI)     |
| `description` | Yes      | A description of what the command does (shown in help)   |
| `prompt`      | No       | Default prompt value used when no arguments are provided |

## Using Custom Commands

Once configured, you can use custom commands in the Forge CLI in two ways:

### Basic Command Execution

To execute a command with its default value (if provided):

```bash
/commit
```

This executes the `commit` command with the default instructions defined in its `value` field.

### Command with Arguments

To override the default value or provide instructions for commands without a default:

```bash
/commit Create a detailed commit message for the login feature
```

```bash
/branch feature/new-auth
```

## How Custom Commands Work

When a custom command is executed, it follows this event flow:

1. **Command Execution**: User types a command like `/commit feat: add user authentication`
2. **Event Dispatch**: Forge dispatches an event with:
   - **Name**: The command name (e.g., `commit`)
   - **Value**: The provided argument or default value (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`)
3. **Agent Subscription**: Any agent that has subscribed to this event name receives the event
4. **Event Processing**: The agent processes the event according to its configuration

## Agent Configuration for Custom Commands

For an agent to respond to a custom command, it must explicitly subscribe to the event with the same name as the command:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: git-commit
    model: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
    system_prompt: "{{> system-prompt-git-commit.hbs }}"
    tools:
      - forge_tool_process_shell
    subscribe:
      - commit # This agent subscribes to the 'commit' custom command
```

## Command Handling Approaches

There are two main approaches for handling custom command events in agents:

### 1. Using Event Value as Instructions

Pass the event value directly to the agent as complete instructions:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: commit
    description: Commit changes with a standard prefix
    prompt: |
      Understand the diff and commit using the 'conventional commit' standard

agents:
  - id: git-commit
    model: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
    system_prompt: "{{> system-prompt-git-commit.hbs }}"
    user_prompt: "{{event.value}}"
    tools:
      - forge_tool_process_shell
    subscribe:
      - commit
```

### 2. Using Event Value as Data in a Template

Incorporate the event value into a structured template:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: analyze
    description: Analyze a file with specific focus

agents:
  - id: file-analyzer
    model: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
    system_prompt: "{{> forge-system-prompt-engineer-act.hbs }}"
    user_prompt: |
      <task>Analyze the following file in detail</task>
      <focus>{{event.value}}</focus>
    tools:
      - forge_tool_fs_read
    subscribe:
      - analyze
```

## Example Custom Commands

### Git Workflow Commands

```yaml
commands:
  - name: commit
    description: Commit changes with a standard prefix
    prompt: |
      Analyze changes and create a commit message following conventional commit format

  - name: branch
    description: Create and checkout a new branch from the current changes

  - name: pr
    description: Create a pull request for current branch
    prompt: |
      Create a detailed pull request description based on the changes in this branch
```

### Development Workflow Commands

```yaml
commands:
  - name: review
    description: Review code for bugs and improvements
    prompt: |
      Review the code for bugs, security issues, performance problems, and suggest improvements

  - name: document
    description: Generate documentation for a file

  - name: test
    description: Generate unit tests for a file or function
    prompt: |
      Create comprehensive unit tests with good coverage for the specified code
```

### Project-Specific Commands

```yaml
commands:
  - name: fixme
    description: Looks for all the fixme comments in the code and attempts to fix them
    prompt: |
      Find all the FIXME comments in source-code files and attempt to fix them.

  - name: deploy
    description: Prepare deployment package and update version numbers
    prompt: |
      Update version numbers and prepare the project for deployment
```

## Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, action-oriented names for commands
2. **Helpful Descriptions**: Write descriptions that explain both the purpose and expected outcome
3. **Default Values**: Provide default values for commands that can work without specific arguments
4. **Specialized Agents**: Configure agents specifically for handling particular commands
5. **Command Organization**: Group related commands in your configuration for easier management
6. **Documentation**: Document custom commands for your team in a project README
