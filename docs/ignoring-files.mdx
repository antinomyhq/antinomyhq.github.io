# Ignoring Files in Forge

Forge respects your existing `.gitignore` and `.ignore` patterns automatically. If you've already set up `.gitignore` for your project, you're done. Forge reads it and applies those rules immediately.

The system is designed to work the way you'd expect: keep sensitive files out of Git with `.gitignore`, and use `.ignore` when you need to hide files from Forge's context without affecting Git.

## Quick Start

**Already have a `.gitignore`?** You're done. Forge uses it automatically.

**Need additional ignore rules?** Create a `.ignore` file in your project root.

**Files still showing up?** Check [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

## How It Works

Forge enables all standard ignore filters by default, processing files through multiple layers:

### Ignore Sources (Precedence Order)

When determining if a file should be ignored, Forge checks these sources in order:

1. **`.ignore` files** - Highest precedence, overrides everything below
2. **`.gitignore` files** - Standard Git ignore patterns
3. **Global gitignore** - From `~/.config/git/ignore` or Git's `core.excludesFile`
4. **`.git/info/exclude`** - Local repository excludes

**Important**: Within each type, more nested ignore files have higher precedence than parent directory ignore files. But any `.ignore` file always overrides all `.gitignore` files, regardless of nesting level.

### How Files Are Filtered

Forge processes each file through these filters in order. If any filter excludes a file, it stops processing:

1. **Ignore files** - Checks `.ignore`, then `.gitignore`, then global ignores
2. **File type matcher** - Skips non-text files and binary content
3. **Hidden files** - Files starting with `.` are skipped (except `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, etc.)

**Example walkthrough for `src/.cache/data.json`:**
- Matched by `.gitignore` pattern `.cache/` → **Excluded**

**Example walkthrough for `config/.env.local`:**
- Not matched by ignore patterns ✓
- Is a text file ✓
- Starts with `.` but parent `config/` doesn't → **Included**

If a file passes all filters, it appears in your file tree.

### Standard Filters Enabled by Default

- **Hidden files** - Files starting with `.` are skipped, but configuration files like `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.env` in your project root are visible
- **Parent directory ignore files** - Respects `.gitignore` in parent directories
- **`.ignore` files** - Same semantics as `.gitignore`, used by ripgrep and ag
- **`.gitignore` files** - Standard Git ignore patterns
- **Global gitignore** - Your personal global ignore file
- **`.git/info/exclude`** - Repository-specific excludes

**Hidden file behavior examples:**
- `.env` in project root → **Visible**
- `.env` in `src/` subdirectory → **Hidden** (in a non-root directory)
- `.cache/` directory anywhere → **Hidden** (directory starts with `.`)
- `src/.DS_Store` → **Hidden** (file in subdirectory starts with `.`)

## Troubleshooting

### I Can't Find My File

**First, figure out WHY it's hidden.** Common causes:

1. **Matched by an ignore pattern** (`.gitignore` or `.ignore`)
2. **Hidden file or directory** (starts with `.` and not in project root)
3. **Binary or non-text file** (Forge skips these)

**Check if Git is ignoring it:**
```bash
git check-ignore -v path/to/file
```

**Example output:**
```
.gitignore:3:node_modules/    node_modules/package/index.js
```
This means line 3 of `.gitignore` is hiding it.

**Important:** `git check-ignore` only checks `.gitignore` patterns. It won't tell you if a file is hidden by `.ignore` or other Forge-specific filters.

**If `git check-ignore` shows nothing but the file is still hidden:**
- Check your `.ignore` file (Git doesn't know about `.ignore` files)
- Verify the file isn't in a hidden directory (like `.cache/`)
- Confirm it's a text file, not binary

**To make a file visible:**

If hidden by `.gitignore`, add to `.ignore`:
```gitignore
!path/to/file
```

If it's a hidden file (starts with `.`), add to `.ignore`:
```gitignore
!.important-config
```

**Remember:** Changes to ignore files require restarting your Forge session.

### My Ignore Patterns Aren't Working

**Pattern syntax checklist:**

✓ Use `/` for paths (even on Windows): `src/build/` not `src\build\`  
✓ Add trailing `/` for directories: `dist/` not `dist`  
✓ Patterns are relative to the ignore file location  
✓ Use `*` for wildcards: `*.log` matches all `.log` files  
✓ Use `**` for recursive matching: `**/temp/` matches `temp/` anywhere

**Test your pattern:**
```bash
# Check if a specific file matches
git check-ignore -v path/to/file

# Find all files matching a pattern
find . -name "*.log"

# Check which of those are ignored
git check-ignore -v $(find . -name "*.log")
```

**Precedence issues:**

If a file should be ignored but isn't:
1. Check if it's whitelisted with `!` in a `.ignore` file
2. Verify the pattern is in the right ignore file (`.ignore` overrides `.gitignore`)
3. Check for more nested ignore files that might override parent patterns

**Still not working?**
- Verify your ignore file is saved
- Restart your Forge session (ignore rules are loaded at startup)
- Check for typos in file paths

### Still Having Issues?

If you've tried the steps above and still can't figure out why a file is hidden or visible, export your session diagnostics:

```bash
/dump html
```

Then share the output in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kRZBPPkgwq) along with:

1. **The specific file path** you're trying to ignore or include
2. **Your `.gitignore` and `.ignore` contents** (or the relevant patterns)
3. **What you expected** vs. what's actually happening
4. **Output from** `git check-ignore -v path/to/file`

This information helps us debug whether it's a pattern issue, precedence problem, or something else entirely.
