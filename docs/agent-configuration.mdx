# Agent Configuration

Forge provides extensive configuration options for AI agents, allowing you to tailor their behavior to your specific needs. This guide covers all available agent configuration options with examples and best practices.

## Core Agent Configuration

In your `forge.yaml` file, agents are defined under the `agents` section:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: assistant
    model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
    system_prompt: "{{> system-prompt.hbs }}"
```

### Basic Configuration Parameters

| Parameter          | Required | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`               | Yes      | Unique identifier for the agent                                       |
| `model`            | Yes      | AI model to use (e.g., anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet)                   |
| `system_prompt`    | Yes      | System prompt or template reference                                   |
| `subscribe`        | No       | List of commands the agent should respond to                          |
| `max_walker_depth` | No       | Maximum directory/file depth for exploration                          |
| `custom_rules`     | No       | Custom instructions or rules (see [Custom Rules](/docs/custom-rules)) |

## Temperature Configuration

Fine-tune the creativity and determinism of agent responses with the `temperature` setting:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: assistant
    model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
    temperature: 0.7
```

The temperature parameter accepts values between 0.0 and 2.0:

| Temperature | Description                           | Best For                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0.0 - 0.3   | Most deterministic, highly consistent | Code generation, factual responses        |
| 0.4 - 0.7   | Balanced creativity and consistency   | General purpose assistance                |
| 0.8 - 1.2   | Increased creativity and variation    | Creative writing, brainstorming           |
| 1.3 - 2.0   | Highest creativity, most varied       | Unconventional ideas, maximum exploration |

### When to Adjust Temperature

- **Lower Temperature (0.0 - 0.3)** when you need:

  - Precise, reproducible code
  - Factual, consistent responses
  - Technical documentation
  - Structured data outputs

- **Medium Temperature (0.4 - 0.7)** when you need:

  - Balanced responses for everyday tasks
  - Natural-sounding text with reasonable variation
  - Problem-solving with some creativity

- **Higher Temperature (0.8 - 2.0)** when you need:
  - Creative writing assistance
  - Diverse brainstorming ideas
  - Out-of-the-box thinking
  - Varied solution approaches

## Context Compaction

Control how conversation history is managed with context compaction:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: assistant
    model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
    compact:
      max_tokens: 2000
      token_threshold: 80000
      model: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
      retention_window: 6
```

For detailed information about context compaction settings, see the [Context Compaction](../context-compaction) documentation.

## Agent Visibility Control

Control whether an agent's outputs are visible in the console with the `hide_content` setting:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: background-helper
    model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
    hide_content: true
```

When `hide_content` is set to `true`:

- The agent's responses won't appear in the console output
- The agent will still function normally in the background
- Other agents can still access its outputs
- This is useful for "helper" agents that support other primary agents

## Best Practices

1. **Match Temperature to Task**: Use lower temperatures for precise tasks and higher for creative ones
2. **Enable Context Compaction**: For long-running sessions or complex projects
3. **Use Base Models Appropriately**: More capable models for complex reasoning, faster models for simpler tasks
4. **Optimize System Prompts**: Use Handlebars templates for dynamic system prompts
5. **Leverage Hidden Agents**: Use background agents for auxiliary tasks without cluttering output

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Agent Responses Too Random

- Lower the temperature setting
- Provide more specific instructions in the system prompt
- Add more detailed custom_rules

### Issue: Agent Responses Too Repetitive

- Increase the temperature slightly
- Review and update system prompt to allow more flexibility
- Check if your instructions are too restrictive

### Issue: Agent Not Seeing Full Context

- Configure context compaction with higher token limits
- Increase retention_window to keep more recent messages
- Use a model with larger context window
