# Built-in Commands and Tools

Forge provides a suite of built-in commands and tools that enhance workflow efficiency and provide system control. Commands are prefixed with a forward slash (`/`) for direct user interaction, while tools are used by AI agents to perform operations and communicate with users.

## Slash Commands

| Command   | Description               | When to Use                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/new`    | Start a new task          | When you've completed your current task and want to begin a fresh conversation           |
| `/info`   | View environment summary  | When you need to check your environment configuration, logs location, or command history |
| `/models` | List available AI models  | When you want to see which AI models are available and their capabilities                |
| `/dump`   | Save conversation to JSON | When you want to save the current conversation for reference or sharing                  |
| `/act`    | Switch to ACT mode        | When you want Forge to execute commands and implement changes (this is the default mode) |
| `/plan`   | Switch to PLAN mode       | When you want Forge to analyze and plan but not modify files                             |
| `/help`   | Display help information  | When you need a reminder of available commands                                           |

## Command Details

### `/new`

The `/new` command clears the current conversation context and starts a fresh task. This is useful when you've completed your current task and want to begin something entirely different.

```bash
/new
```

**When to use**: Use this when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure a clean context.

### `/info`

The `/info` command displays information about your environment, including system details, logs location, and command history.

```bash
/info
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need to troubleshoot, find log files, or review your recent commands.

### `/models`

The `/models` command lists all available AI models with their capabilities and context limitations.

```bash
/models
```

**Example output**:

```
Available models:
- anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet (Context: 200K tokens)
- anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku (Context: 200K tokens)
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want to check which models are available or understand their capabilities.

### `/dump`

The `/dump` command saves the current conversation in JSON format to a file for future reference.

```bash
/dump
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want to save a particularly useful conversation for documentation, sharing, or reference.

### `/act`

The `/act` command switches Forge to ACT mode, where it can execute commands and implement changes.

```bash
/act
```

**When to use**: This is the default mode. Use this command to switch back to ACT mode if you were previously in PLAN mode.

### `/plan`

The `/plan` command switches Forge to PLAN mode, where it analyzes and suggests changes without modifying files.

```bash
/plan
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want Forge to analyze your codebase and suggest changes without actually implementing them. This is useful for understanding what would happen before making changes.

### `/help`

The `/help` command displays information about available commands and their usage.

```bash
/help
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need a quick reminder of the available commands and their functions.

## Core Tools

Forge agents use a variety of tools to interact with your system and provide information. The following are some of the most important tools:

### User Communication Tool

#### tool_forge_display_show_user

This tool allows agents to display richly formatted information using markdown. It renders properly formatted content in your terminal with support for headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and text emphasis.

```javascript
tool_forge_display_show_user({
  content: "# Analysis Results\n\n- **Issue found**: Memory leak in module X\n- **Solution**: Update allocation strategy"
})
```

**Key features**:
- Rich markdown rendering in the terminal
- Support for complex formatting including tables and code blocks
- Improved readability for complex information
- Visual hierarchy through headings and emphasis

**Example output**:

```
# Analysis Results

- **Issue found**: Memory leak in module X
- **Solution**: Update allocation strategy
```

For a complete reference of all available tools including file operations, network requests, and process management, see the [Tools Reference](../tools-reference) documentation.

## Best Practices

- **Start Fresh**: Use `/new` when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure the context is clean.
- **Preserve Knowledge**: Use `/dump` to save valuable conversations that you might want to reference later.
- **Understand Before Acting**: Use `/plan` to see what actions Forge would take before allowing it to make changes.
- **Check System Status**: Use `/info` when something isn't working as expected to diagnose potential issues.
- **Select Appropriate Models**: Use `/models` to understand which model is best for your specific task.
- **Improve Readability**: Agents use `tool_forge_display_show_user` to make complex information more readable with markdown formatting.
- **Create Custom Commands**: Define your own [custom commands](../custom-commands) for project-specific operations and workflows.
