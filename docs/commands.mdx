# Built-in Commands

Forge offers several built-in commands to enhance your interaction. These commands can be entered directly in the Forge CLI by typing the command name preceded by a forward slash.

## /new

Start a new conversation while preserving history.

The `/new` command clears the current conversation context and starts a fresh task. This is useful when you've completed your current task and want to begin something entirely different.

**When to use:** Use this when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure a clean context.

## /info

Display comprehensive system environment and status information.

The `/info` command provides a detailed overview of your current Forge environment, including paths, configuration, model settings, token usage, and conversation details.

**Example output:**

```
‚ùØ /info

**When to use:** Use this when you need to troubleshoot, find configuration files, check token usage, verify your current model setup, or get an overview of your Forge environment.

## /model

Switch to a different model.

The `/model` command allows you to interactively select from available AI models and set your preferred model in the project's forge.yaml configuration file.

This will:

1. Display an interactive selection menu with all available models
2. Update the standard_model anchor in your forge.yaml file with your selection
3. Confirm the change with a success message

The model choice will persist between sessions as it's stored in your configuration file.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to change which AI model Forge uses for processing your requests.

## /agent

Switch between different AI agents.

The `/agent` command provides an interactive interface to select and switch between different specialized agents in Forge. Use this command to change which agent handles your requests and see available options.

This will:

1. Display an interactive selection menu with available agents:

   - **Forge Agent**: Full execution capabilities with read-write access
   - **Muse Agent**: Read-only analysis and planning mode

2. Switch to the selected agent for the current session

**When to use:** Use this when you want to switch between agents or when you're unsure which agent is currently active. This is an alternative to using the specific `/forge` or `/muse` commands.

## /dump

Save conversation as JSON or HTML.

The `/dump` command saves the current conversation to a file for future reference. By default, it saves in JSON format, but you can specify HTML format using `/dump html`.

**Usage:**

- `/dump` - Saves as JSON format
- `/dump html` - Saves as HTML format

**When to use:** Use this when you need to debug issues, inspect the conversation context, or report problems to the development team.

## /forge

Enable implementation mode with code changes.

The `/forge` command (also available as `/act`) switches to Forge Agent, where it can execute commands and implement changes.

**When to use:** This is the default agent. Use this command to switch back to the Forge Agent if you were previously using the Muse Agent.

## /muse

Enable planning mode without code changes.

The `/muse` command (also available as `/plan`) switches to the Muse Agent, where it analyzes and suggests changes without modifying files.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to analyze your codebase and suggest changes without actually implementing them. This is useful for understanding what would happen before making changes.

## /compact

Compact the conversation context.

The `/compact` command reduces the conversation context by summarizing or removing older messages to optimize memory usage and performance.

**When to use:** Use this when you have a long conversation and want to reduce context size while preserving important information.

## /help

Display all available commands.

The `/help` command prints a list of all available Forge commands with their descriptions, providing a quick reference for command usage.

**When to use:** Use this when you need to see what commands are available or want a quick reference of Forge's built-in functionality.

## /tools

List all available tools with their descriptions and schema.

The `/tools` command displays a comprehensive list of all available tools, including their descriptions and schema information.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to see what tools are available or need to understand tool capabilities and parameters.

## /update

Updates to the latest compatible version of forge.

The `/update` command updates Forge to the latest compatible version available.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to update to the newest version of Forge with the latest features and bug fixes.

## /login

Log into the Forge provider.

The `/login` command authenticates you with the default Forge provider.

**When to use:** Use this when you need to authenticate with the Forge service or when your session has expired.

## /logout

Logout of the current session.

The `/logout` command ends your current authenticated session with the Forge provider.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to end your current session or switch to a different account.

## /exit

Exit the application.

The `/exit` command terminates the Forge application.

**When to use:** Use this when you want to quit Forge completely.
