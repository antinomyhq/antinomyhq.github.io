# Built-in Commands

Forge provides a suite of built-in commands prefixed with a forward slash (`/`) that enhance workflow efficiency and provide system control. These commands can be used directly in the Forge terminal interface.

## Available Slash Commands

| Command   | Description               | When to Use                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/new`    | Start a new task          | When you've completed your current task and want to begin a fresh conversation           |
| `/info`   | View environment summary  | When you need to check your environment configuration, logs location, or command history |
| `/models` | List available AI models  | When you want to see which AI models are available and their capabilities                |
| `/dump`   | Save conversation to JSON | When you need to debug issues or report problems to the development team                 |
| `/act`    | Switch to ACT mode        | When you want Forge to execute commands and implement changes (this is the default mode) |
| `/plan`   | Switch to PLAN mode       | When you want Forge to analyze and plan but not modify files                             |
| `/help`   | Display help information  | When you need a reminder of available commands                                           |
| `/exit`   | Exit the application      | When you want to cleanly exit the Forge CLI                                              |

## Command Details

### `/new`

The `/new` command clears the current conversation context and starts a fresh task. This is useful when you've completed your current task and want to begin something entirely different.

```bash
/new
```

**When to use**: Use this when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure a clean context.

### `/info`

The `/info` command displays information about your environment, including system details, logs location, and command history.

```bash
/info
```

**Example output**:

```
System Information:
- OS: macOS Monterey 12.6
- Architecture: x86_64
- Shell: /bin/zsh

Environment:
- Current Directory: /Users/username/projects
- Forge Version: 0.8.2

Log Files:
- Location: /Users/username/.forge/logs
- Debug Log: debug.log
- Error Log: error.log

Recent Commands:
1. analyze this codebase
2. fix the bug in auth.js
3. /models
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need to troubleshoot, find log files, or review your recent commands.

### `/models`

The `/models` command lists all available AI models with their capabilities and context limitations.

```bash
/models
```

**Example output**:

```
Available models:
- anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet (Context: 200K tokens)
- anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku (Context: 200K tokens)
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want to check which models are available or understand their capabilities.

### `/dump`

The `/dump` command saves the current conversation in JSON format to a file for future reference.

```bash
/dump
```

**Example output**:

```
Conversation saved to: /Users/username/2023-03-15_14-22-37-dump.json
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need to debug issues, inspect the conversation context, or report problems to the development team.

### `/act`

The `/act` command switches Forge to ACT mode, where it can execute commands and implement changes.

```bash
/act
```

**Example output**:

```
Switched to ACT mode. Forge will now implement changes when instructed.
```

**When to use**: This is the default mode. Use this command to switch back to ACT mode if you were previously in PLAN mode.

### `/plan`

The `/plan` command switches Forge to PLAN mode, where it analyzes and suggests changes without modifying files.

```bash
/plan
```

**Example output**:

```
Switched to PLAN mode. Forge will analyze and plan but NOT implement changes.
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want Forge to analyze your codebase and suggest changes without actually implementing them. This is useful for understanding what would happen before making changes.

### `/help`

The `/help` command displays information about available commands and their usage.

```bash
/help
```

**When to use**: Use this when you need a quick reminder of the available commands and their functions.

### `/exit`

The `/exit` command cleanly exits the Forge CLI application.

```bash
/exit
```

**When to use**: Use this when you want to close Forge. Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl+D`.

## Custom Commands

In addition to these built-in commands, Forge allows you to define your own custom commands in your `forge.yaml` configuration file. These custom commands can be used to trigger specific agents to perform specialized tasks.

For information about creating custom commands, see the [Custom Commands](/docs/custom-commands) documentation.

## Best Practices

- **Start Fresh**: Use `/new` when switching between unrelated tasks to ensure the context is clean.
- **Debug Context**: Use `/dump` for debugging purposes when you need to inspect the conversation context or report issues.
- **Understand Before Acting**: Use `/plan` to see what actions Forge would take before allowing it to make changes.
- **Check System Status**: Use `/info` when something isn't working as expected to diagnose potential issues.
- **Select Appropriate Models**: Use `/models` to understand which model is best for your specific task.
- **Create Custom Commands**: Define your own [custom commands](/docs/custom-commands) for project-specific operations and workflows.
