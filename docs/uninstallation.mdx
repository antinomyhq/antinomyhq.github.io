Uninstall Forge Code from your system.

## Clean Up Configuration and Data

After uninstalling the main application, you may want to remove associated configuration files and data:

  <Step title="Remove Forge configuration directory">
    Delete the `forge` folder from your home directory. This folder contains your authentication tokens, custom agents, and local configurations.

    **Location:**

    - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\forge\`

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove project-specific configurations (optional)">

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check command availability">
    ```bash
    forge --version
