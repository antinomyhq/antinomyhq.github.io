# Logout & Uninstall Forge

Log out from Forge or uninstall Forge Code from your system.

## Logout from Forge

If you want to temporarily stop using Forge without removing the installation, you can simply log out from your current session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Forge and log out">
    ```bash
    # Start Forge
    forge

    # Inside the Forge session, log out:
    /logout
    ```

    This disconnects you from the Forge provider but keeps the application installed for future use.

  </Step>
</Steps>

:::info Quick Return
After logging out, you can start using Forge again anytime by running `forge` and completing authentication.
:::

## Uninstallation

### For Global npm Uninstallation

If you installed Forge using `npm install -g forgecode@latest`, follow these steps to uninstall:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Uninstall">
    ```bash
    npm uninstall -g forgecode
    ```

    This removes the globally installed Forge package from your system.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Removal">
    Check that Forge has been removed:

    ```bash
    forge --version
    ```

    You should see an error indicating the command is not found, confirming successful removal.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### For npx Usage

If you've been using `npx forgecode@latest`, **no uninstallation is required**. The npx command downloads and runs Forge temporarily without installing it permanently on your system.

:::info No Installation = No Uninstallation
Since `npx forgecode@latest` doesn't install anything permanently, there's nothing to uninstall. Each time you run the command, it downloads the latest version temporarily.
:::

Optionally, you can clear the npx cache to free up disk space:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

## Clean Up Configuration and Data

After uninstalling the main application, you may want to remove associated configuration files and data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Remove Forge configuration directory">
    Delete the `forge` folder from your home directory. This folder contains your authentication tokens, custom agents, and local configurations.

    **Location:**
    - **macOS/Linux**: `~/forge/`
    - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\forge\`

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove project-specific configurations (optional)">
    Look for `forge.yaml` files in your project directories and delete them if no longer needed. These files contain project-specific Forge settings and agent configurations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify Removal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check command availability">
    ```bash
    forge --version
    ```

    The command should return "not found" or a similar error.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Uninstallation

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors during uninstallation:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
sudo npm uninstall -g forgecode
```

**Windows (Run as Administrator):**

```cmd
npm uninstall -g forgecode
```

### npm Cache Issues

If you experience issues with npm, clear the npm cache:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```
