# Shell Keybindings Reference

Forge's interactive shell provides essential keyboard shortcuts designed to enhance your productivity and make command-line interaction more efficient.

## Core Keybindings

### Tab Completion
- **Key**: `Tab`
- **Action**: 
  - Shows the completion menu
  - If there's an exact match, it will be automatically inserted
- **Example**: Type partial command and press `Tab` to see available completions

### Clear Screen
- **Key**: `Ctrl + k`
- **Action**: 
  - Clears the terminal screen
  - If the line is empty, clears the screen
  - If the line has content, deletes from cursor to end of line

### History Search
- **Key**: `Ctrl + r`
- **Action**: 
  - Opens interactive search through command history
  - Type to filter previous commands
  - Press `Enter` to execute the selected command

### Insert Newline
- **Keys**: 
  - `Alt + Enter`
  - `Ctrl + j`
  - `Shift + Enter`
- **Action**: 
  - Inserts a newline without executing the command
  - Useful for multi-line commands or scripts
  - Multiple key combinations are provided for compatibility with different terminals

## Note
The shell also supports standard `Emacs-style` keybindings for text navigation and editing, which will be familiar to experienced command-line users.
